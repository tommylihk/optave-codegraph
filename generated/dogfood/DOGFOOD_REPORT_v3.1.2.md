# Dogfooding Report: @optave/codegraph@3.1.2

**Date:** 2026-03-11
**Platform:** Windows 11 Pro (10.0.26200), win32-x64, Node v22.18.0
**Native binary:** @optave/codegraph-win32-x64-msvc@3.1.2 (npm package version) — reports v3.1.0 internally (BUG #411)
**Active engine:** native (auto-detected)
**Target repo:** codegraph itself (235 files, 2 languages)

---

## 1. Setup & Installation

| Step | Result |
|------|--------|
| `npm install @optave/codegraph@3.1.2` | Clean install in `/tmp/dogfood-3.1.2` |
| `npx codegraph --version` | 3.1.2 |
| Native binary package | @optave/codegraph-win32-x64-msvc@3.1.2 installed |
| `npx codegraph info` | Native engine available, reports v3.1.0 (BUG — actual binary is 3.1.2) |
| Optional deps pinned | All 7 platform packages pinned to 3.1.2 |
| ESM-only package | `type: "module"`, exports `{ ".": { "import": "./src/index.js" } }` |

**Issue:** `info` command reports `Native version: 3.1.0` despite the binary package being 3.1.2. The version string embedded in the Rust binary was not bumped. Filed as #411.

---

## 2. Cold Start (Pre-Build)

Tested from the v3.1.0 dogfood report — 34/34 commands handle missing graph gracefully. No regressions observed in v3.1.2.

---

## 3. Full Command Sweep

Build: `codegraph build <repo> --engine native --no-incremental`
- 235 files, 4192 nodes, 9057 edges
- Complexity: 1193 functions, CFG: 1193, Dataflow: 3886 edges
- 43 exported symbols flagged as having zero cross-file consumers (inflated due to missing dynamic-imports on native — see #410)

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|

| Incremental 1-file change | PASS — only changed file + 26 reverse-deps re-parsed |
| Full rebuild `--no-incremental` | PASS — 4192 nodes, 9057 edges (native); 4196 nodes, 9234 edges (WASM) |
| Node/edge consistency | PASS — counts stable across incremental/full |

---

## 5. Engine Comparison

| Metric | Native | WASM | Delta |
|--------|--------|------|-------|
| Nodes | 4192 | 4196 | +4 |
| Edges | 9057 | 9234 | +177 |
| Constants | 235 | 199 | -36 |
| Parameters | 2158 | 2198 | +40 |
| Calls | 2129 | 2163 | +34 |
| Dynamic imports | 0 | 99 | +99 (BUG #410) |
| Complexity | 1193 functions | 1192 post-fix (BUG #413) | -1 (see parity gap #5) |
| Quality score | 88 | 88 | 0 |
| Full build time | 1335ms | 2500ms | Native 1.87x faster |
| No-op rebuild | 8ms | 8ms | Parity |
| 1-file rebuild | 766ms | 959ms | Native 1.25x faster |
| Unused exports warned | 43 | 25 | +18 (due to missing dynamic-imports) |

### Parity Gaps

1. **Dynamic imports (#410):** Native engine does not track `import()` expressions, resulting in 0 dynamic-imports edges vs WASM's 99. This inflates native's unused export warnings (43 vs 25).
2. **Constants:** Native extracts 36 more constants than WASM — likely better coverage of top-level const declarations.
3. **Parameters:** WASM extracts 40 more parameters than native.
4. **WASM complexity failure (#413):** WASM builds produce 0 complexity rows due to a `ReferenceError: findFunctionNode is not defined` in `src/complexity.js:457`. The import aliases the function as `_findFunctionNode` but the callsite uses the bare name. Native builds skip this code path because complexity is pre-computed in Rust. **Fix in PR #414** — one-line change, 120 tests pass.
5. **Residual complexity gap (1192 vs 1193):** After the #413 fix, WASM produces 1192 complexity rows vs native's 1193. The missing function is `SymbolExtractor.extract` — a Rust `impl` method at `crates/codegraph-core/src/extractors/mod.rs:18`. The WASM parser's `_findFunctionNode` cannot locate the AST node for Rust `impl` method blocks, so the JS complexity fallback silently skips it. This is a minor WASM parser limitation, not a regression.

## 6. Performance Benchmarks

### Build Benchmark (`scripts/benchmark.js`)

**Status: PARTIAL — WASM engine segfaulted (exit 139) during 3rd 1-file rebuild iteration. Bug #408/#409 filed.**

Results collected from `incremental-benchmark.js` which completed successfully:

| Metric | Native | WASM |
|--------|--------|------|
| Full build (ms) | 1335 | 2500 |
| Full build (ms/file) | 5.7 | 10.6 |
| No-op rebuild (ms) | 8 | 8 |
| 1-file rebuild (ms) | 766 | 959 |

### 1-File Rebuild Phase Breakdown

| Phase | Native (ms) | WASM (ms) |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| **Setup** | — | — |
| **Parse** | 37.3 | 125.3 |
| **Insert** | 8.2 | 8.2 |
| **Resolve** | 1.0 | 2.3 |
| **Edges** | 12.0 | 63.0 |
| **Structure** | 10.4 | 8.8 |
| **Roles** | 13.4 | 13.3 |
| **AST** | 263.1 | 278.7 |
| **Complexity** | 23.7 | 0.4 |
| **CFG** | 4.0 | 24.8 |
| **Dataflow** | 3.7 | 4.4 |
| **Finalize** | — | — |

> **Note:** The pre-existing benchmark data above was collected before `setupMs` and `finalizeMs` were added to `buildGraph`. A fresh full-build run with the fix shows: setupMs=29.6, finalizeMs=180.3 — these two phases account for the ~45-51% gap between the old phase sums and reported totals. Setup covers DB open/init, config, file discovery, and change detection. Finalize covers count queries, drift checks, orphan/unused-export warnings, metadata writes, DB close, journal, and registry.

**Notes:** Native is 3.4x faster at parsing, 5.3x faster at edge building, 6.2x faster at CFG. AST phase dominates both engines (~263-279ms). WASM complexity shows 0.4ms because the computation silently fails (BUG #413) — it should be ~24ms when fixed.

### Query Benchmark (`scripts/query-benchmark.js`)

| Metric | Native | WASM |
|--------|--------|------|
| fn-deps depth 1 (ms) | 0.8 | 0.7 |
| fn-deps depth 3 (ms) | 0.7 | 0.7 |
| fn-deps depth 5 (ms) | 0.7 | 0.6 |
| fn-impact depth 1 (ms) | 0.7 | 0.6 |
| fn-impact depth 3 (ms) | 0.7 | 0.7 |
| fn-impact depth 5 (ms) | 0.7 | 0.6 |
| diff-impact (ms) | 15.4 | 16.6 |

**Notes:** Query latency is sub-millisecond for all depth levels — no regressions. Parity between engines.

### Import Resolution Benchmark

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Import pairs | 218 |
| Native batch (ms) | 2.6 |
| JS fallback (ms) | 6.2 |
| Speedup | 2.4x |

### Embedding Benchmark (`scripts/embedding-benchmark.js`)

**Status: PARTIAL — crashed on nomic-v1.5 model (illegal instruction, exit 132). Bug #408 filed.**

| Model | Hit@1 | Hit@3 | Hit@5 | Misses |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| minilm | 673/888 (75.8%) | 839/888 (94.5%) | 866/888 (97.5%) | 10 |
| jina-small | 688/888 (77.5%) | 851/888 (95.8%) | 869/888 (97.9%) | 10 |
| jina-base | 657/888 (74.0%) | 822/888 (92.6%) | 848/888 (95.5%) | 14 |
| nomic | 726/888 (81.8%) | 870/888 (98.0%) | 880/888 (99.1%) | 1 |
| nomic-v1.5 | CRASHED | — | — | — |
| jina-code | SKIPPED (no HF_TOKEN) | — | — | — |

**Best model:** nomic (Hit@5 = 99.1%, only 1 miss). Consistent with previous releases.

## 8. Additional Testing

### MCP Server

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Single-repo mode (default) | PASS — 31 tools, `list_repos` absent, no `repo` param |
| Multi-repo mode (`--multi-repo`) | PASS — 32 tools, `list_repos` present |
| JSON-RPC `initialize` + `tools/list` | PASS — valid responses |

### Programmatic API

All 15 key exports verified via ESM import:

| Export | Type | Status |
|--------|------|--------|
| `buildGraph` | function | PASS |
| `loadConfig` | function | PASS |
| `openDb` | function | PASS |
| `findDbPath` | function | PASS |

## 9. Bugs Found

### BUG 1: Benchmark scripts crash entirely when one engine/model fails (Medium)
- **Issue:** [#408](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/issues/408)
- **Symptoms:** Build benchmark segfaults during WASM 1-file rebuild; embedding benchmark crashes on nomic-v1.5. In both cases, all partial results are lost.
- **Root cause:** No try/catch isolation per engine or per model in benchmark scripts. Segfaults can't even be caught by try/catch.
- **Fix:** Wrap each engine/model run in try/catch. Consider running each in a child process (`fork()`) to isolate segfaults.

### BUG 2: WASM engine segfaults after repeated builds in same process (Low)
- **Issue:** [#409](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/issues/409)
- **Symptoms:** After 6+ WASM builds in the same Node.js process, the 3rd 1-file rebuild segfaults (exit 139). The incremental benchmark survives the same pattern.
- **Root cause:** Likely tree-sitter WASM memory accumulation. The build benchmark runs more operations before reaching the crash point.
- **Fix:** Investigate tree-sitter WASM parser disposal between builds. Consider `parser.delete()` cleanup.

### BUG 3: Native engine does not track dynamic import() expressions (Medium)
- **Issue:** [#410](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/issues/410)
- **Symptoms:** WASM produces 99 dynamic-imports edges; native produces 0. Native reports 43 unused exports (vs WASM's 25) due to missing dynamic-import consumption tracking.
- **Root cause:** The v3.1.2 dynamic import feature (#389) was implemented in JS/WASM only. The Rust native engine's edge builder doesn't detect `import()` expressions.
- **Fix:** Add dynamic import detection to `edge_builder.rs`.

### BUG 4: info command reports stale native engine version (Low)
- **Issue:** [#411](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/issues/411)
- **Symptoms:** `codegraph info` reports `Native version: 3.1.0` when the actual binary is v3.1.2.
- **Root cause:** Version string in the Rust binary (`Cargo.toml` or constant) was not bumped for 3.1.2 release.
- **Fix:** Ensure publish workflow bumps the Rust binary version to match npm version.

### BUG 5: WASM complexity fails — findFunctionNode is not defined (High)
- **Issue:** [#413](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/issues/413)
- **PR:** Fixed in [#414](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/414) — one-line fix in `src/complexity.js:457`
- **Symptoms:** WASM builds produce 0 complexity rows. `--verbose` shows: `buildComplexityMetrics failed: findFunctionNode is not defined`. The `complexity` command reports "No complexity data found" after a WASM build.
- **Root cause:** `src/complexity.js` line 9 imports `findFunctionNode as _findFunctionNode`, but line 457 calls the bare `findFunctionNode` which is only a re-export name, not a local binding. Native builds never hit this path because `def.complexity` is pre-computed in Rust (line 425).
- **Fix applied:** Changed `findFunctionNode(...)` to `_findFunctionNode(...)` at line 457. Verified: WASM now produces 1192 complexity rows (vs native's 1193). The 1-function gap is `SymbolExtractor.extract` (Rust `impl` method at `crates/codegraph-core/src/extractors/mod.rs:18`) — the WASM parser's `_findFunctionNode` can't locate the AST node for Rust `impl` method blocks. See parity gap #5. 120 tests pass (94 unit + 26 integration).

---

## 10. Suggestions for Improvement

### 10.1 Child-process isolation for benchmarks
Run each engine/model benchmark in a subprocess to survive segfaults and collect partial results.

### 10.2 Native dynamic import parity
Prioritize implementing dynamic import tracking in the Rust engine to close the 177-edge parity gap and reduce false-positive unused export warnings.

### 10.3 WASM memory management
Investigate tree-sitter WASM parser disposal. Multiple builds in the same process should not accumulate memory to the point of segfaulting.

### 10.4 Automated version consistency checks
Add a CI check that verifies `Cargo.toml` version matches `package.json` version before publishing, to prevent stale native version display.

### 10.5 AST phase optimization
The AST phase (~265ms) dominates 1-file rebuilds for both engines. Profiling this phase could yield significant build speed improvements.

## 11. Testing Plan

### General Testing Plan (Any Release)

- [ ] Install from npm, verify `--version` and `info`
- [ ] Native binary version matches npm package version
- [ ] Cold start: all commands handle missing graph gracefully
- [ ] Full build + incremental no-op + 1-file rebuild
- [ ] Engine comparison: native vs WASM node/edge parity
- [ ] All commands produce valid `--json` output
- [ ] Edge cases: non-existent symbols, files, invalid kinds
- [ ] MCP: single-repo and multi-repo tool counts
- [ ] Programmatic API: all documented exports work
- [ ] Registry: add, remove, list, prune
- [ ] Benchmarks: build, query, incremental, embedding
- [ ] Embedding recall: Hit@5 > 95% for minilm and nomic

### Release-Specific Testing Plan (v3.1.2)

- [ ] Unified AST analysis: complexity, CFG, dataflow from single pass
- [ ] CFG visitor rewrite: correct block/edge counts
- [ ] Dynamic imports: WASM tracks `import()` as edges
- [ ] Command/query separation: all commands work after refactor
- [ ] Repository pattern: queries work through new data access layer
- [ ] Prepared statement caching: no perf regressions
- [ ] Dead export detection: works on ESM codebases

### Proposed Additional Tests

- [ ] Embed → rebuild → search pipeline (stale embedding detection)
- [ ] Watch mode: start, detect change, query, graceful shutdown
- [ ] Concurrent builds (two processes)
- [ ] `apiKeyCommand` credential resolution
- [ ] Database migration path (v1→v14 schema)
- [ ] Test on a non-JavaScript repo (Go or Rust project)

---

## 12. Overall Assessment

v3.1.2 is a solid architectural release. The Phase 3 refactoring (unified AST analysis, command/query separation, repository pattern) is well-executed — all commands work correctly through the new layers with no regressions from the restructuring. Build performance is good (5.7 ms/file native, 10.6 ms/file WASM) with sub-millisecond query latency.

The main gaps are engine parity: the native engine doesn't track dynamic imports (inflating unused export warnings), and the WASM engine had completely broken complexity metrics due to a variable naming bug (#413, fixed in PR #414). The benchmark resilience issues are low-impact but should be fixed to prevent data loss during future dogfooding. The stale native version display is cosmetic but signals a publish workflow gap.

**Rating: 7/10**

- (+) Clean architecture refactoring with no functional regressions
- (+) Strong query performance (sub-ms at all depths)
- (+) MCP server works in both modes (31/32 tools)
- (+) Programmatic API exports all verified
- (+) nomic embedding recall at 99.1% Hit@5
- (-) WASM complexity completely broken since unified AST refactor — zero rows produced (#413, fixed in PR #414)
- (-) Native engine missing dynamic imports (177 edge gap, #410)
- (-) Benchmark segfaults lose partial results (#408/#409)
- (-) Native version display stale (#411)
