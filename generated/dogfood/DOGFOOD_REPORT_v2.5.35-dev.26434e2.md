# Dogfooding Report: @optave/codegraph@2.5.35-dev.26434e2

**Date:** 2026-03-02
**Platform:** Windows 11 Pro (10.0.26200), x86_64, Node v22.18.0
**Native binary:** @optave/codegraph-win32-x64-msvc@2.5.35-dev.26434e2 (manually extracted; npm install fails)
**Native internal version:** 0.1.0
**Active engine:** native (v0.1.0) when available; wasm fallback
**Target repo:** codegraph itself (142 files, 912 nodes, 1671 edges)

---

## 1. Setup & Installation

### Install method
Dev builds are not on npm. Installed from GitHub release tarballs:
```bash
npm install https://github.com/optave/codegraph/releases/download/dev-v2.5.35-dev.26434e2/optave-codegraph-2.5.35-dev.26434e2.tgz
```
Main package installed successfully.

### Native binary issue
`npm install <native-tarball-url>` fails with `TypeError: Invalid Version:` in npm's arborist deduplication logic. **Workaround:** manually download and extract the tarball into `node_modules/@optave/codegraph-win32-x64-msvc/`. Any subsequent `npm install` removes the manually-extracted package. Filed as **#237**.

### Native binary version mismatch
`codegraph info` reports native version as `0.1.0` while the package version is `2.5.35-dev.26434e2`. The internal version string in the Rust addon has not been updated — cosmetic only, no functional impact.

### Verification
- `npx codegraph --version` → `2.5.35-dev.26434e2` (**PASS**)
- `npx codegraph info` → native engine available, active (**PASS**)

---

## 2. Cold Start (Pre-Build)

## 4. Rebuild & Staleness

### Incremental no-op
After full build, running `build` again correctly detects "No changes detected. Graph is up to date." Tier 1 mtime+size check skips all 142 files. **PASS**.

### Incremental with change
Modified `src/logger.js`, ran `build`:
- Tier 1 detected 1 file needing hash check
- Tier 2 confirmed 1 actually changed
- Re-parsed 32 files (1 changed + 31 reverse-deps)
- **BUG:** `[codegraph WARN] Skipping src: EISDIR` — the `src` directory is leaking into the re-parse set (#235)
- **BUG:** Edge count after incremental (676) does not match full rebuild (1671) (#236)

### Full rebuild (--no-incremental)
Produces consistent results: 912 nodes, 1516 edges (build output), 1671 edges (stats). The difference is because stats counts all edge types (calls + imports + contains + reexports).

### Embed → rebuild → search
- Embedded 721 symbols with minilm (384d)
- Modified file, rebuilt incrementally
- Search still returns results — no stale embedding crash
- Recall quality is reasonable for minilm model

### Engine change detection
When engine changes between builds (native → wasm), correctly warns:
```
Engine changed (native → wasm). Consider rebuilding with --no-incremental for consistency.
```
**PASS**.

---

## 5. Engine Comparison

### Build performance

| Metric | Native | WASM | Speedup |
|--------|--------|------|---------|
| Full build (ms) | 302 | 826 | **2.7x** |
| No-op rebuild (ms) | 5 | 6 | 1.2x |
| 1-file rebuild (ms) | 233 | 381 | 1.6x |
| Parse phase (ms) | 49 | 367 | **7.5x** |
| Complexity phase (ms) | 5 | 130 | **26x** |
| Insert phase (ms) | 13 | 15 | 1.1x |
| Resolve phase (ms) | 22 | 25 | 1.1x |
| Edges phase (ms) | 38 | 42 | 1.1x |

### Graph parity

| Metric | Native | WASM | Match |
|--------|--------|------|-------|
| Nodes | 912 | 912 | YES |
| Edges | 1671 | 1671 | YES |
| Calls | 1253 | 1253 | YES |
| Files | 142 | 142 | YES |
| Quality score | 86 | 86 | YES |
| Call confidence | 98.3% | 98.3% | YES |
| Caller coverage | 67.9% | 67.9% | YES |
| DB size | 757,760 | 757,760 | YES |

**Perfect parity** between native and WASM engines. All metrics match exactly.

### Query performance

| Query | Native (ms) | WASM (ms) |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| fnDeps depth 1 | 1.0 | 0.9 |
| fnDeps depth 3 | 1.0 | 1.0 |
| fnDeps depth 5 | 1.0 | 0.9 |
| fnImpact depth 1 | 0.9 | 0.9 |
| fnImpact depth 3 | 0.9 | 0.9 |
| fnImpact depth 5 | 0.9 | 0.9 |
| diff-impact | 14.9 | 16.1 |

Query latencies are near-identical (sub-millisecond) — queries are SQL-based, not engine-dependent.

### Import resolution

| Resolver | Time (ms) | Per-import (ms) |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Native batch | 4.7 | ~0 |
| JS fallback | 4.8 | ~0 |

Both resolvers produce identical results at comparable speed for this codebase size.

| `audit` command — composite risk report | Tested on file target and function target, with `--json` | PASS — combines explain + impact + health |
| `triage` command — risk audit queue | Tested `-T --json` | PASS — ranked by composite risk score |
| `snapshot` save/restore/list/delete | Full lifecycle tested | PASS |
| `owners` — CODEOWNERS integration | Tested; no CODEOWNERS file in repo | PASS — graceful "No CODEOWNERS file found" |
| Architecture boundary rules | `manifesto -T` includes `boundaries` rule | PASS — boundaries rule passes |
| Onion architecture preset | Preset available in manifesto | PASS |
| Hybrid BM25 + semantic search | `search` uses combined ranking when FTS5 available | PASS — shows BM25 rank + semantic rank |
| Batch querying | `batch where`, `batch context` with multiple targets | PASS — all targets processed |
| `check` as MCP tool | Verified in `tools/list` response | PASS — present in 30 single-repo tools |
| CODEOWNERS parse cache fix | No CODEOWNERS in repo; cannot deeply test | N/A |
| Dev build versioning | `--version` returns `2.5.35-dev.26434e2` | PASS |

---

## 7. Additional Testing

### MCP Server

- Multi-repo mode (`--multi-repo`): 31 tools, `list_repos` present. **PASS**.
- JSON-RPC `initialize` response is well-formed. **PASS**.

### Programmatic API
- 131 exports verified via ESM `import *`.
- All critical exports are functions/objects of the expected types.
- CJS `require()` correctly fails (ESM-only package). **PASS**.

### Config
- `.codegraphrc.json` is loaded when present (confirmed via `--verbose` output: "Loaded config from ...\.codegraphrc.json"). **PASS**.

### Registry
- `registry list` shows registered repos with paths and timestamps.
- `registry list --json` produces valid JSON array.
- Repos auto-register on `build`. **PASS**.

## 8. Bugs Found

### BUG 1: EISDIR warning during incremental rebuild (Medium) — RESOLVED in v2.6.0
- **Issue:** [#235](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/issues/235)
- **PR:** [#241](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/241)
- **Symptoms:** `[codegraph WARN] Skipping src: EISDIR: illegal operation on a directory, read` during incremental rebuild after modifying a single source file
- **Root cause:** The `src` directory node leaks into the re-parse file set during reverse-dep computation
- **Impact:** Cosmetic warning; the directory is skipped and build completes. One fewer file is parsed than expected.

> Fixed in v2.6.0: filter directory nodes from reverse-deps query to prevent EISDIR on incremental rebuilds.

### BUG 2: Incremental rebuild edge count mismatch (High) — RESOLVED in v2.6.0
- **Issue:** [#236](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/issues/236)
- **PR:** [#241](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/241)
- **Symptoms:** After a 1-file incremental rebuild, `stats` reports a different edge count than a full rebuild of the same codebase. Full build: 1671 edges. Incremental: varies (676 in one test, 2660 in another)
- **Root cause:** The incremental path re-parses only changed files + reverse-deps. Edge cleanup/insertion may not preserve edges from unchanged files correctly.
- **Impact:** Queries after incremental rebuilds may return incomplete results.

> Fixed in v2.6.0: load unchanged barrel files into reexportMap, add drift detection, barrel-project fixture and incremental-parity test.

### BUG 3: Dev build native binary tarball install fails via npm (Medium) — RESOLVED in v2.6.0
- **Issue:** [#237](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/issues/237)
- **PR:** [#241](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/241)
- **Symptoms:** `npm install <tarball-url>` fails with `TypeError: Invalid Version:` in npm's arborist
- **Root cause:** npm's semver parser may not handle the `2.5.35-dev.26434e2` version format during deduplication
- **Impact:** Dev build users must manually extract the native binary tarball

> Fixed in v2.6.0: `--strip` flag in `sync-native-versions.js` removes platform optionalDependencies in dev builds.

### MINOR: Native addon version string is `0.1.0`
- Not filed as issue — cosmetic. The Rust addon's internal version string hasn't been updated to match the package version. `codegraph info` shows `Native version: 0.1.0`.

---

## 9. Suggestions for Improvement

### 9.1 Incremental rebuild verification — RESOLVED in v2.6.0
Add an assertion or warning in the build process that compares the post-incremental edge/node count against the previous full-build count. If they diverge significantly, suggest `--no-incremental`.

> v2.6.0 added node/edge count drift detection after incremental builds — warns when counts drift >20% and suggests `--no-incremental`. Threshold is configurable via `build.driftThreshold`.

### 9.2 Embedding benchmark should declare `@huggingface/transformers` as a devDependency — SUPERSEDED in v2.5.0
The embedding benchmark script fails because `@huggingface/transformers` is an optional dep that doesn't auto-install. Consider making it a devDependency so benchmark scripts work out of the box.

> Superseded: v2.5.0 added an interactive install prompt in `embedder.js` when the package is missing, and the optional-dep design is intentional to avoid bloating installs for contributors who don't need ML models.

### 9.3 `complexity` should warn when data is missing — RESOLVED in v2.6.0
When `complexity` returns "No complexity data found" but a graph exists, it should suggest `build --no-incremental` to populate the data, rather than implying no graph exists.

> v2.6.0 improved the missing-data message — now suggests `--no-incremental` rebuild instead of implying no graph exists.

### 9.4 Dev build install documentation — RESOLVED in v2.6.0
The SKILL.md documents the manual tarball installation, but a note in the README or release notes about the `npm install <url>` failure would help users.

> v2.6.0 fixed the underlying `npm install` failure with `--strip` flag in `sync-native-versions.js`, making manual extraction unnecessary.

## 10. Testing Plan

### General Testing Plan (Any Release)
- [ ] Install from published package (npm or tarball)
- [ ] Verify `--version` and `info` output
- [ ] Cold start: all commands without graph produce helpful errors
- [ ] Build graph on codegraph itself
- [ ] Full command sweep with `--json` and `-T` flags
- [ ] Incremental no-op rebuild
- [ ] Incremental 1-file rebuild: verify edge/node counts match full rebuild
- [ ] Engine comparison: native vs WASM parity
- [ ] Export in all formats (DOT, Mermaid, JSON)
- [ ] Embed + search pipeline
- [ ] MCP server single-repo and multi-repo tool counts
- [ ] Programmatic API exports
- [ ] Edge cases: non-existent symbols/files, invalid kinds
- [ ] Run all 4 benchmark scripts
- [ ] Snapshot save/restore lifecycle

### Release-Specific Testing Plan (v2.6.0)
- [x] `check` command with all predicates (`--cycles`, `--blast-radius`, `--signatures`, `--boundaries`)
- [x] `audit` command on file and function targets
- [x] `triage` command with risk ranking
- [x] `snapshot` full lifecycle (save, list, restore, delete)
- [x] `owners` command (with and without CODEOWNERS file)
- [x] `manifesto` boundary rules including onion preset
- [x] Hybrid BM25 + semantic search
- [x] `batch` command with multiple targets
- [x] `check` in MCP tool list
- [x] Dev build version format in `--version` output

### Proposed Additional Tests
- Watch mode: start watcher, modify file, verify incremental update, query, stop watcher
- Concurrent builds: two build processes simultaneously
- Config override testing: `.codegraphrc.json` with custom `include`/`exclude`, `aliases`, `query.defaultDepth`
- Registry add/remove/prune lifecycle from scratch
- Cross-repo queries via MCP multi-repo mode
- `apiKeyCommand` credential resolution with a test `echo` command
- Database migration path: open graph.db from an older version
- `embed` with different models and verify dimension mismatch handling

---

## 11. Overall Assessment

Codegraph v2.5.35-dev.26434e2 (v2.6.0-rc) is a solid release with significant new capabilities. The `check`, `audit`, `triage`, and `snapshot` commands all work correctly and produce well-structured output. Hybrid search with BM25 + semantic ranking is a meaningful improvement. The MCP server correctly differentiates single-repo (30 tools) and multi-repo (31 tools) modes.

**Native/WASM parity is perfect** — both engines produce identical graphs with identical metrics. Native is 2.7x faster overall and 26x faster for complexity analysis.

The three bugs found are:
1. **EISDIR during incremental rebuild** — a directory leaks into the parse set (medium severity, cosmetic warning)
2. **Incremental edge count mismatch** — the most concerning bug, as it means incremental builds may produce incomplete graphs (high severity)
3. **Dev build native binary install fails** — npm's arborist can't handle the tarball install, requiring manual extraction (medium severity, dev workflow only)

The incremental edge count bug (#236) is the most impactful finding and should be investigated before a stable release. The other issues are lower priority.

**Rating: 7.5/10** — Strong feature set, perfect engine parity, but the incremental rebuild bug undermines trust in the most common build path.
