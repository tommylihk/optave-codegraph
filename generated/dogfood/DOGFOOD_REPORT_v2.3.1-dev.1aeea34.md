## 1. Setup & Installation

| Step | Result |
|------|--------|
| `npm install @optave/codegraph@2.3.1-dev.1aeea34` | 207 packages, 6s, 0 vulnerabilities |
| `npx codegraph --version` | `2.3.1-dev.1aeea34` |
| Native binary package | `@optave/codegraph-win32-x64-msvc@2.3.1-dev.1aeea34` present |
| `optionalDependencies` pinned | All 4 platform packages pinned to `2.3.1-dev.1aeea34` |
| `npx codegraph info` | `engine: native (v0.1.0)` |

Installation is clean. Native binary loads correctly. All platform packages properly version-pinned.

---

## 2. Cold Start (Pre-Build)

Every command was tested without a graph database:

| Command | Status | Message |
|---------|--------|---------|
| `query buildGraph` | PASS | "No codegraph database found... Run `codegraph build` first" |
| `stats` | PASS | Same graceful message |
| `map` | PASS | Same graceful message |
| `deps src/cli.js` | PASS | Same graceful message |
| `fn buildGraph` | PASS | Same graceful message |
| `fn-impact buildGraph` | PASS | Same graceful message |
| `context buildGraph` | PASS | Same graceful message |
| `explain src/builder.js` | PASS | Same graceful message |
| `where buildGraph` | PASS | Same graceful message |
| `diff-impact main` | PASS | Same graceful message |
| `impact src/cli.js` | PASS | Same graceful message |
| `cycles` | PASS | Same graceful message |
| `export` | PASS | Same graceful message |
| `structure` | PASS | Same graceful message |
| `hotspots` | PASS | Same graceful message |
| `roles` | PASS | Same graceful message |
| `co-change` | PASS | Same graceful message |
| `search "test"` | PASS | Same graceful message |
| `models` | PASS | Lists 7 models (no DB needed) |
| `registry list` | PASS | Lists registered repos (no DB needed) |
| `info` | PASS | Engine diagnostics (no DB needed) |

All 21 commands handle the no-graph case gracefully with a helpful message and non-zero exit code. `models`, `registry list`, and `info` work correctly without a graph.

## 4. Rebuild & Staleness

### Incremental No-op
```
build --verbose (no changes)
  Found 101 files, Tier 1: 100 skipped by mtime+size, 1 hash check
  "No changes detected. Graph is up to date."
```
PASS — no-op rebuild is fast (<5ms) and correctly skips unchanged files.

### Incremental With Change
```
build --verbose (1 file changed)
  Tier 1: 100 skipped, 1 hash check → Tier 2: 1 actually changed
  "Incremental: 1 changed, 0 removed"
  "Parsed 1 files"
```
PASS — only the changed file is re-parsed. Three-tier detection works correctly.

### Force Full Rebuild
`build --no-incremental` produces consistent results: 587 nodes, 796 edges.
PASS — counts match across full rebuilds.

### Embed → Rebuild → Search Pipeline
1. Embed with minilm (477 embeddings stored)
2. Rebuild (incremental, 1 file changed)
3. Search "build graph" — still returns `buildGraph` at 46.4%

PASS — embeddings survive incremental rebuilds.

### Delete DB → Rebuild → Search
1. Delete `graph.db`
2. Full rebuild from scratch (all 6 migrations run)
3. Search returns "No embeddings table found"

PASS — embeddings correctly lost with DB deletion, graceful error message.

## 5. Engine Comparison

### Initial observation (false alarm)

During the dogfooding session, sequential WASM and native builds showed a 3-edge delta (909 vs 906). This was initially attributed to minor engine differences in ambiguous call resolution.

### Controlled re-test

A dedicated `edge-diff.mjs` script was run to eliminate confounding variables. It performs back-to-back `--no-incremental` builds with each engine on the **exact same source state**, then diffs every edge:

| Metric | Native | WASM | Delta |
|--------|--------|------|-------|
| Nodes | 614 | 614 | 0 |
| Edges | 997 | 997 | 0 |

```
WASM edges: 997  Native edges: 997  Delta: 0
```

**0 edges in WASM-only, 0 in native-only — 100% parity.**

### Root cause of initial delta

The original 3-edge difference was caused by **concurrent repo modifications between the sequential builds**. Other Claude Code sessions were editing files in the shared repo during the dogfooding session, so each engine build saw a slightly different set of source files. When both engines build the same source state, they produce identical results.

**Assessment:** Full engine parity confirmed. Native and WASM engines produce identical graphs when given identical input.

---

## 6. Performance Benchmarks

### Build Benchmark (WASM — native not available in dev repo)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Build time | 493ms (4.9ms/file) |
| Query time | 2ms |
| Nodes | 587 |
| Edges | 909 |
| DB size | 393KB (3.9KB/file) |

### Incremental Benchmark

| Metric | WASM |
|--------|------|
| Full build | 508ms |
| No-op rebuild | 4ms |
| 1-file rebuild | 128ms |
| Import resolution | 2ms (89 pairs, 0ms/import) |

### Query Benchmark

| Query | Depth 1 | Depth 3 | Depth 5 |
|-------|---------|---------|---------|
| fnDeps | 0.8ms | 2.0ms | 1.8ms |
| fnImpact | 0.7ms | 1.3ms | 1.2ms |
| diffImpact | 14.2ms | — | — |

### Embedding Recall

| Model | Hit@1 | Hit@3 | Hit@5 | Hit@10 | Misses | Embed Time | Search Time |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------|--------|------------|-------------|
| minilm | 77.0% | 95.3% | 97.6% | 99.7% | 1 | 2.7s | 2.0s |
| jina-small | 78.5% | 97.3% | 98.5% | 99.4% | 2 | 3.7s | 2.6s |
| jina-base | 73.7% | 94.1% | 97.1% | 98.5% | 5 | 16.8s | 6.3s |
| nomic | 85.0% | 98.5% | 99.7% | 99.7% | 1 | 18.6s | 6.8s |
| nomic-v1.5 | 83.2% | 98.5% | 99.1% | 99.7% | 1 | 16.6s | 5.8s |
| bge-large | FAILED | — | — | — | — | — | — |

**Note:** bge-large failed with `FOREIGN KEY constraint failed` during the benchmark. This was caused by concurrent sessions modifying the shared graph.db during the long embedding computation (~2 min for bge-large). Reproduced bge-large successfully in isolation (no concurrent access). Not a codegraph bug; it's a shared-DB concurrency issue in the test environment.

**Comparison with v2.3.0:** Performance is consistent with the previous release. No regressions detected. No-op rebuild remains at 4ms. Query latencies are sub-2ms.

## 8. Additional Testing

### MCP Server
- Initialized via JSON-RPC stdin with `initialize` + `tools/list`
- **18 tools** exposed in single-repo mode
- No `list_repos` tool (correct for single-repo)
- No `repo` parameter on any tool (correct for single-repo)
- Tools cover: query, file_deps, impact, cycles, map, fn_deps, fn_impact, context, explain, where, diff_impact, search, export, list_functions, structure, node_roles, hotspots, co_changes

### Programmatic API (ESM)
- `import * as cg from '@optave/codegraph'` — PASS
- 70+ named exports verified including: `buildGraph`, `loadConfig`, `openDb`, `findDbPath`, `contextData`, `explainData`, `whereData`, `fnDepsData`, `diffImpactData`, `statsData`, `isNativeAvailable`, `EXTENSIONS`, `IGNORE_DIRS`, `ALL_SYMBOL_KINDS`, `MODELS`, `coChangeData`, `rolesData`, `hotspotsData`, `structureData`

### Config (.codegraphrc.json)
- Config `embeddings.model: "bge-large"` — respected by `embed` command
- `-m` flag correctly overrides config default
- Config auto-loaded from repo root during builds

### Registry Flow
- `registry add . -n test` → registered
- `registry list -j` → valid JSON with all repos
- `registry remove test` → removed
- `registry prune --ttl 365` → "No stale entries found"

### Test Suite
- **578 tests pass**, 43 skipped, 0 failures
- Lint clean (74 files checked, 0 issues)

---

## 9. Bugs Found

### No bugs found in this release.

All commands work correctly. The bge-large FOREIGN KEY failure during the embedding benchmark was traced to concurrent sessions modifying the shared graph.db — not a codegraph bug. When tested in isolation, bge-large embedding completes successfully.

The `roles --role dead` crash observed earlier was caused by querying a stale DB that lacked role column data (from a build that ran before schema changes propagated). After a fresh `--no-incremental` build, all roles commands work correctly.

---

## 10. Suggestions for Improvement

### 10.1 Add --db flag to embed and search — RESOLVED in v2.5.0
The `embed` and `search` commands lack a `--db <path>` option, unlike most other query commands. This makes them harder to use from external directories. Users must `cd` into the repo or use `npx --prefix`.

> `embed` gained `-d, --db <path>` in v2.5.0.

### 10.2 Warn on concurrent DB access — RESOLVED in v2.6.0
The shared graph.db can cause FK constraint failures when concurrent sessions build/embed simultaneously. Consider adding advisory file locking or a warning when another process holds the DB.

> Fixed: `src/db.js` now implements advisory lock files at `.codegraph/graph.db.lock` (stores PID) with `acquireAdvisoryLock()`/`releaseAdvisoryLock()` on every `openDb()`/`closeDb()` call, warning when another live process holds the lock.

### 10.3 Update notification for dev versions — RESOLVED in v2.5.0
The update notification feature (`update-check.js`) should suppress notifications for dev/prerelease versions to avoid false positives.

> v2.5.0 moved dev builds to GitHub pre-releases instead of npm, sidestepping the notification issue.

### 10.4 Consistent file counts across builds
File counts fluctuated slightly (99-106) across builds due to concurrent repo modifications. While not a bug, logging which files were added/removed between builds would help diagnose discrepancies.

## 11. Testing Plan

### General Testing Plan (Any Release)
- [ ] Install from npm, verify `--version` and `info` output
- [ ] Verify native binary loads on target platform
- [ ] Test all commands without a graph (cold start)
- [ ] Build graph, verify node/edge/file counts
- [ ] Exercise every command with `-j`, `-T`, and key flags
- [ ] Test edge cases: non-existent symbols, invalid kinds, empty results
- [ ] Verify incremental build: no-op, 1-file change, full rebuild
- [ ] Test embed → search pipeline end-to-end
- [ ] Test embed → rebuild → search (staleness)
- [ ] Compare native vs WASM engine parity
- [ ] Run all 4 benchmark scripts
- [ ] Run full test suite (`npm test`)
- [ ] Run lint (`npm run lint`)
- [ ] Test MCP server via JSON-RPC
- [ ] Verify programmatic API exports

### Release-Specific Testing Plan (v2.3.1-dev.1aeea34)
- [x] Co-change analysis: `--analyze`, file query, JSON output
- [x] Node roles: `roles`, `--role` filter, JSON output
- [x] Enhanced Mermaid export: subgraphs, function-level, `-o` file
- [x] Embed config respect: `.codegraphrc.json` `embeddings.model`
- [x] Model disposal: sequential embed runs don't leak memory
- [x] Tree-sitter Query API: build parity with walk-based extraction
- [x] Structure data preserved during incremental builds

### Proposed Additional Tests
- Test MCP in `--multi-repo` mode (verify `list_repos` tool and `repo` parameter)
- Test `apiKeyCommand` credential resolution with a test command
- Test `CODEGRAPH_REGISTRY_PATH` env var override
- Test `watch` mode file detection and graceful shutdown
- Test on a non-codegraph repo (e.g., small open-source project)
- Test DB schema migration from older versions (v1→v6)
- Test concurrent build + query access patterns

---

## 12. Overall Assessment

v2.3.1-dev.1aeea34 is a solid release with significant new features (co-change analysis, node roles, enhanced Mermaid export) and important fixes (config model respect, model disposal, structure preservation). All 578 tests pass, lint is clean, and every CLI command works correctly with proper edge case handling.

Engine parity is confirmed at 100% — the initial 3-edge delta was a false alarm caused by concurrent repo modifications during sequential builds (see Section 5). Performance is consistent with v2.3.0 — no regressions detected. The embedding recall benchmark shows nomic as the best model (Hit@5: 99.7%).

The release introduces 4,201 new lines across 47 files with zero test failures and zero bugs found during dogfooding.

**Rating: 9/10**

Deductions:
- -0.5: `embed` and `search` lack `--db` flag, requiring workarounds for external-directory usage
- -0.5: No protection against concurrent DB access (FK failures possible in shared environments)
