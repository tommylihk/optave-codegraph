# AI Agent Guide for Codegraph

How to use codegraph to make AI coding agents faster, cheaper, and safer.

## The Problem

AI agents waste tokens and make blind edits because they lack structural awareness:

- **Token waste:** Agents `cat` entire files to find one function. A 500-line file costs ~2000 tokens when the agent only needs a 15-line function and its signature.
- **Stale context:** Grep-based navigation misses structural changes. Renaming a function shows the definition but not all the call sites that broke.
- **Blast radius blindness:** Agents edit a function without knowing who calls it. The fix works locally but breaks three callers upstream.
- **Scattered dependencies:** Understanding a function requires reading its callees, their callees, the tests — agents piece this together with 10+ file reads.

Codegraph solves these problems by providing a pre-built dependency graph that agents can query in a single call.

### Token Savings

| Task | Without codegraph | With codegraph | Savings |
|------|------------------|----------------|---------|
| Understand a function | Read 3–5 full files (~10K tokens) | `context <name>` (~400 tokens) | ~96% |
| Find what a file does | Read the file + imports (~4K tokens) | `audit --quick <file>` (~300 tokens) | ~92% |
| Locate a symbol | Grep + read matches (~3K tokens) | `where <name>` (~60 tokens) | ~98% |
| Assess change impact | Read callers manually (~5K tokens) | `fn-impact <name>` (~200 tokens) | ~96% |
| Pre-commit check | Manual review (~8K tokens) | `diff-impact --staged` (~300 tokens) | ~96% |

## The 6-Step Agent Workflow

Use this sequence for any coding task — bug fix, feature, or refactor:

### Step 1: Orient

Get a high-level view of the codebase before diving in.

```bash
codegraph map --limit 20       # Most-connected modules
codegraph stats                # Graph health: nodes, edges, languages, quality score
codegraph structure            # Directory tree with cohesion scores
```

**When to use:** Start of a session, or when working in an unfamiliar codebase.

### Step 2: Locate

Find where the relevant symbol lives.

```bash
codegraph where <name>              # Fast lookup: definition + usage sites
codegraph where --file <path>       # File overview: symbols, imports, exports
codegraph search "error handling"   # Semantic search (requires prior `embed`)
```

**When to use:** You know what you're looking for (a function name, a concept) but not where it is.

### Step 3: Understand

Get a structural summary without reading raw source.

```bash
codegraph audit --quick <file>      # File summary: public API, internal API, data flow
codegraph audit --quick <function>  # Function summary: signature, calls, callers, tests
```

**When to use:** Before modifying anything. Understand the shape of the code first.

### Step 4: Gather Context

Pull everything needed to make the change — in one call.

```bash
codegraph context <name> -T         # Source + deps + callers + tests (no test files)
codegraph context <name> --depth 1  # Include callee source code too
codegraph query <name> -T           # Lighter: just callers/callees chain
```

**When to use:** You've decided what to change and need the full picture to write correct code.

### Step 5: Assess Impact

Check what will break before making changes.

```bash
codegraph fn-impact <name> -T       # Function-level blast radius
codegraph impact <file>             # File-level transitive dependents
codegraph diff-impact main          # Impact of all changes vs a branch
```

**When to use:** Before editing, to know the blast radius. After editing, to verify nothing unexpected is affected.

### Step 6: Verify

Check staged changes before committing.

```bash
codegraph diff-impact --staged -T   # Impact of what you're about to commit
codegraph cycles                    # Ensure no new circular dependencies
codegraph stats                     # Confirm graph quality hasn't degraded
```

**When to use:** After staging changes, before the commit.

| `guard-git.sh` | PreToolUse (Bash) | Blocks dangerous git ops, validates commits |
| `track-edits.sh` | PostToolUse (Edit, Write) | Logs edits for commit validation |

### `enrich-context.sh` — Auto-inject dependency context

**Trigger:** Before any Read or Grep operation.

**What it does:** Runs `codegraph deps <file> --json` and injects the result as `additionalContext`. The agent automatically sees what the file imports, what imports it, and what symbols it defines — without making a separate call.

**Example output the agent sees:**

```
[codegraph] src/builder.js
  Imports: src/parser.js, src/db.js, src/resolve.js, src/logger.js
  Imported by: src/cli.js, tests/integration/queries.test.js
  Defines: function buildGraph, function collectFiles, function hashFile
```

**Requirements:** `.codegraph/graph.db` must exist (run `codegraph build` first). Fails gracefully if missing.

### `remind-codegraph.sh` — Nudge the agent to check before editing

**Trigger:** Before any Edit or Write operation (PreToolUse).

**What it does:** The first time the agent edits a source file, the hook injects a reminder via `additionalContext` to run `where`, `audit --quick`, `context`, and `fn-impact` before proceeding. Subsequent edits to the same file in the same session are silently allowed (tracked in `.claude/codegraph-checked.log`).

**Example output the agent sees:**

```
[codegraph reminder] You are about to edit src/parser.js. Did you run codegraph first?
Before editing, always: (1) where <name>, (2) audit --quick src/parser.js,
(3) context <name> -T, (4) fn-impact <name> -T. If you already did this, proceed.
```

**Design:** Non-blocking (always allows the edit), skips non-source files (`.md`, `.json`, `.yml`, etc.), and only fires once per file per session to avoid noise. The checked log is gitignored.

### `update-graph.sh` — Keep the graph fresh

**Trigger:** After any Edit or Write operation.

**What it does:** Runs `codegraph build` incrementally. Only source files trigger a rebuild (`.js`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.py`, `.go`, `.rs`, `.java`, `.cs`, `.php`, `.rb`, `.tf`, `.hcl`). Test fixtures are skipped.

**Result:** The graph stays current as the agent edits code. Subsequent `context`, `fn-impact`, and `diff-impact` calls reflect the latest changes.

### `check-readme.sh` — Enforce doc updates alongside source changes

**Trigger:** Before any Bash command (PreToolUse).

**What it does:** Intercepts `git commit` commands and checks whether source files are staged (anything under `src/`, `cli.js`, `constants.js`, `parser.js`, `package.json`, or `grammars/`). If so, it verifies that `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `ROADMAP.md` are also staged. Missing docs trigger a `deny` decision listing which files weren't staged and what to review in each — language support tables, architecture docs, feature lists, roadmap phases, etc.

**Allows:** Commits that only touch non-source files (tests, docs, config) pass through without checks. Commits where all three docs are staged also pass through.

### `guard-git.sh` — Prevent unsafe git operations

**Trigger:** Before any Bash command.

**What it does:**
- **Blocks** broad staging (`git add .`, `git add -A`), resets, reverts, clean, and stash
- **Validates branches** on push (must match conventional prefix: `feat/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, etc.)
- **Validates commits** by comparing staged files against the session edit log — blocks commits that include files the agent didn't edit

**Allows:** `git restore --staged <file>` for safe unstaging.

### `track-edits.sh` — Session edit audit trail

**Trigger:** After any Edit or Write operation.

**What it does:** Appends the edited file path with a timestamp to `.claude/session-edits.log`. This log is read by `guard-git.sh` to validate commits.

## CLAUDE.md Template

Add this to your project's `CLAUDE.md` to teach Claude Code about codegraph:

```markdown
## Codegraph

This project uses codegraph for dependency analysis. The graph is at `.codegraph/graph.db`.

### Before modifying code, always:
1. `codegraph where <name>` — find where the symbol lives
2. `codegraph audit --quick <file-or-function>` — understand the structure
3. `codegraph context <name> -T` — get full context (source, deps, callers)
4. `codegraph fn-impact <name> -T` — check blast radius before editing

### After modifying code:
5. `codegraph diff-impact --staged -T` — verify impact before committing

### Commands
- `codegraph build .` — rebuild the graph (incremental by default)
- `codegraph map` — module overview
- `codegraph stats` — graph health and quality score
- `codegraph audit <target> -T` — combined structural summary + impact + health in one report
- `codegraph triage -T` — ranked audit priority queue
- `codegraph check --staged` — CI validation predicates (exit code 0/1)
- `codegraph batch target1 target2` — batch query multiple targets at once
- `codegraph query <name> -T` — function call chain
- `codegraph deps <file>` — file-level dependencies
- `codegraph exports <file> -T` — per-symbol export consumers
- `codegraph children <name> -T` — sub-declarations (parameters, properties, constants)
- `codegraph dataflow <name> -T` — data flow edges (requires `build --dataflow`)
- `codegraph cfg <name> -T` — control flow graph (requires `build --cfg`)
- `codegraph ast --kind call <name> -T` — search stored AST nodes
- `codegraph owners [target]` — CODEOWNERS mapping for symbols
- `codegraph snapshot save <name>` — checkpoint the graph DB before refactoring
- `codegraph search "<query>"` — semantic search (requires `codegraph embed`)
- `codegraph cycles` — check for circular dependencies

### Flags
- `-T` / `--no-tests` — exclude test files (use by default)
- `-j` / `--json` — JSON output for programmatic use
- `-f, --file <path>` — scope to a specific file
- `-k, --kind <kind>` — filter by symbol kind
```

## CI/CD Integration

### PR Impact Comments

Add a GitHub Actions workflow that posts `diff-impact` results on every PR:

```yaml
- name: Build graph
  run: npx @optave/codegraph build .

- name: Analyze PR impact
  run: |
    npx @optave/codegraph diff-impact origin/${{ github.base_ref }} --json -T > impact.json

- name: Comment on PR
  uses: actions/github-script@v7
  with:
    script: |
      const impact = require('./impact.json');
      const body = `### Codegraph Impact Analysis\n\n` +
        `**${impact.summary.changedFunctions} functions changed**, ` +
        `affecting **${impact.summary.totalAffected} functions** across ` +
        `**${impact.affectedFiles.length} files**`;
      github.rest.issues.createComment({
        issue_number: context.issue.number, owner: context.repo.owner,
        repo: context.repo.repo, body
      });
```

### Threshold Gates

Fail the build if impact exceeds a threshold:

```yaml
- name: Check impact threshold
  run: |
    AFFECTED=$(npx @optave/codegraph diff-impact origin/main --json -T | node -e "
      const d = require('fs').readFileSync('/dev/stdin','utf8');
      console.log(JSON.parse(d).summary.totalAffected);
    ")
    if [ "$AFFECTED" -gt 50 ]; then
      echo "::error::Impact too high: $AFFECTED functions affected (threshold: 50)"
      exit 1
    fi
```

### Graph Caching

Cache the graph database between CI runs:

```yaml
- uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: .codegraph/
    key: codegraph-${{ hashFiles('src/**', 'package.json') }}
    restore-keys: codegraph-
```

---

## Git Hooks

### Pre-commit: Rebuild Graph

Ensure the graph is current before every commit:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
npx @optave/codegraph build . 2>/dev/null
```

### Pre-push: Impact Check

Warn if changes have high impact:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# .git/hooks/pre-push
IMPACT=$(npx @optave/codegraph diff-impact origin/main --json -T 2>/dev/null)
AFFECTED=$(echo "$IMPACT" | node -e "
  let d=''; process.stdin.on('data',c=>d+=c);
  process.stdin.on('end',()=>console.log(JSON.parse(d).summary?.totalAffected||0));
")
if [ "$AFFECTED" -gt 30 ]; then
  echo "Warning: pushing changes that affect $AFFECTED functions"
  echo "Run 'codegraph diff-impact origin/main -T' to review"
fi
```

### Commit Message Enrichment

Append impact summary to commit messages:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# .git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg
IMPACT=$(npx @optave/codegraph diff-impact --staged --json -T 2>/dev/null)
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  SUMMARY=$(echo "$IMPACT" | node -e "
    let d=''; process.stdin.on('data',c=>d+=c);
    process.stdin.on('end',()=>{
      const j=JSON.parse(d);
      if(j.summary) console.log('Impact: '+j.summary.changedFunctions+' changed, '+j.summary.totalAffected+' affected');
    });
  ")
  if [ -n "$SUMMARY" ]; then
    echo "" >> "$1"
    echo "$SUMMARY" >> "$1"
  fi
fi
```

## Tips for Agents

1. **Always use `-T` / `--no-tests`** unless you're specifically working on tests. Test files add noise to impact and context results.

2. **Prefer `context` over raw file reads.** One `context` call replaces 3–5 file reads and gives you structured, relevant data.

3. **Use `--file` to disambiguate.** Many codebases have functions with the same name in different files. `codegraph query parse --file parser.js` avoids ambiguity.

4. **Check impact before and after.** Run `fn-impact` before editing to know the blast radius. Run `diff-impact --staged` after to verify your changes.

5. **Use `audit --quick` for orientation, `context` for implementation.** `audit --quick` gives you the shape of the code. `context` gives you the actual source you need to write changes.

6. **Multi-query semantic search.** When searching, phrase the same intent multiple ways: `codegraph search "parse imports, resolve require, extract dependencies"`. RRF ranking combines the results.

7. **Use `where --file` for file inventory.** Before editing a file, `where --file <path>` gives you a quick list of all symbols, imports, and exports — cheaper than reading the file.

8. **Check `stats` for quality.** The quality score (0–100) tells you if the graph is trustworthy. Low scores mean missing edges or unresolved imports — rebuild or investigate.

9. **Scope with `--kind`.** If you only care about classes, `--kind class` filters out functions and methods. Valid kinds: function, method, class, interface, type, struct, enum, trait, record, module, parameter, property, constant.

10. **JSON for programmatic use.** When chaining commands or processing results, always use `-j` for reliable machine-readable output.
