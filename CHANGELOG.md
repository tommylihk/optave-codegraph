## [3.1.5](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/compare/v3.1.4...v3.1.5) (2026-03-16)

**Phase 3 architectural refactoring completes.** This release finishes the remaining two Phase 3 roadmap tasks — domain directory grouping (3.15) and CLI composability (3.16) — bringing Phase 3 to 14 of 14 tasks complete. The `src/` directory is now reorganized into `domain/`, `features/`, and `presentation/` layers. A new `openGraph()` helper eliminates DB-open/close boilerplate across CLI commands, and a universal output formatter adds `--table` and `--csv` output to all commands. Several post-reorganization bugs are fixed: complexity/CFG/dataflow analysis restored after the move, MCP server imports corrected, worktree boundary escapes prevented, CJS `require()` support added, and LIKE wildcard injection in queries patched.

### Features

* **cli:** `openGraph()` helper and universal output formatter with `--table` and `--csv` output formats — eliminates per-command DB boilerplate and format-switching logic ([#461](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/461))

### Bug Fixes

* **builder:** restore complexity/CFG/dataflow analysis that silently stopped running after src/ reorganization ([#469](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/469))
* **db:** prevent `findDbPath` from escaping git worktree boundary — stops codegraph from accidentally using a parent repo's database ([#457](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/457))
* **mcp:** update MCP server import path after src/ reorganization ([#466](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/466))
* **api:** add CJS `require()` support to package exports — fixes `ERR_REQUIRE_ESM` for CommonJS consumers ([#472](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/472))
* **db:** escape LIKE wildcards in `NodeQuery.fileFilter` and `nameLike` — prevents filenames containing `%` or `_` from matching unrelated rows ([#446](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/446))

### Refactors

* **architecture:** reorganize `src/` into `domain/`, `features/`, `presentation/` layers — completes Phase 3.15 domain directory grouping ([#456](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/456))
* **architecture:** move remaining flat `src/` files into subdirectories ([#458](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/458))
* **architecture:** resolve three post-reorganization issues (circular imports, barrel exports, path corrections) ([#459](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/459))
* **queries:** deduplicate BFS impact traversal and centralize config loading ([#463](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/463))
* **tests:** migrate integration tests to InMemoryRepository for faster execution ([#462](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/462))

### Tests

* **db:** add `findRepoRoot` and `findDbPath` ceiling boundary tests ([#475](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/475))

## [3.1.4](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/compare/v3.1.3...v3.1.4) (2026-03-16)

**Phase 3 architectural refactoring reaches near-completion.** This release delivers 11 of 14 roadmap tasks in Phase 3 (Vertical Slice Architecture), restructuring the codebase from a flat collection of large files into a modular subsystem layout. The 3,395-line `queries.js` is decomposed into `src/analysis/` and `src/shared/` modules. The MCP tool registry becomes composable. CLI commands are self-contained modules under `src/commands/`. A domain error hierarchy replaces ad-hoc throws. The build pipeline is decomposed into named stages. The embedder is extracted into `src/embeddings/` with pluggable stores and search strategies. A unified graph model (`src/graph/`) consolidates four parallel graph representations. Nodes gain qualified names, hierarchical scoping, and visibility metadata. An `InMemoryRepository` enables fast unit testing without SQLite. The presentation layer (`src/presentation/`) separates all output formatting from domain logic. `better-sqlite3` is bumped to 12.8.0.

### Features

* **graph-model:** unified in-memory `CodeGraph` model with 3 builders, 6 algorithms, and 2 classifiers — consolidates four parallel graph representations into `src/graph/` ([#435](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/435), [#436](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/436))
* **qualified-names:** `qualified_name`, `scope`, and `visibility` columns on nodes (migration v15) — enables direct lookups like "all methods of class X" without edge traversal ([#437](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/437))
* **testing:** `InMemoryRepository` for unit tests without SQLite — repository pattern now supports in-memory and persistent backends ([#444](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/444))

### Refactors

* **queries:** decompose `queries.js` (3,395 lines) into `src/analysis/` and `src/shared/` modules ([#425](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/425))
* **mcp:** composable MCP tool registry — tools defined alongside their implementations ([#426](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/426))
* **cli:** split `cli.js` into self-contained command modules under `src/commands/` ([#427](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/427))
* **api:** curate public API surface — explicit exports, remove internal leaks ([#430](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/430))
* **errors:** domain error hierarchy — typed errors replace ad-hoc throws ([#431](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/431))
* **embeddings:** extract embedder into `src/embeddings/` subsystem with pluggable stores and search strategies ([#433](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/433))
* **builder:** decompose `buildGraph()` into named pipeline stages ([#434](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/434))
* **presentation:** extract all output formatting into `src/presentation/` — viewer, export, table, sequence renderer, result formatter ([#443](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/443))

### Chores

* **ci:** add backlog compliance phase to automated PR review ([#432](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/432))
* **deps:** bump better-sqlite3 from 12.6.2 to 12.8.0 ([#442](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/442))
* **deps-dev:** bump @biomejs/biome from 2.4.6 to 2.4.7 ([#441](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/441))
* **deps-dev:** bump @commitlint/cli from 20.4.3 to 20.4.4 ([#440](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/440))
* **deps-dev:** bump @commitlint/config-conventional from 20.4.3 to 20.4.4 ([#439](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/439))
* **deps-dev:** bump @vitest/coverage-v8 from 4.0.18 to 4.1.0 ([#438](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/438))

## [3.1.3](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/compare/v3.1.2...v3.1.3) (2026-03-11)

**Bug fixes and build instrumentation.** This patch fixes WASM builds silently producing zero complexity rows, resolves four dogfood-reported issues (benchmark crash resilience, WASM parser memory cleanup, native dynamic import tracking, stale native version reporting), and adds missing build phase timers so `setupMs` and `finalizeMs` now account for the previously untracked ~45% of total build time. Prepared statement caching is extracted into a reusable `cachedStmt` utility.

### Features

* **builder:** add `setupMs` and `finalizeMs` phase timers to `buildGraph` — closes the ~45% gap in phase breakdown accounting ([#415](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/415))

### Bug Fixes

* **complexity:** fix WASM builds producing zero `function_complexity` rows — incorrect import alias caused `findFunctionNode` to be undefined in WASM-only path ([#414](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/414))
* **native:** track `import()` expressions in Rust extractor — adds `dynamicImport` field to `Import` struct, matching WASM behavior for dead-export analysis ([#418](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/418))
* **native:** report correct native package version in `codegraph info` — reads from platform npm package.json instead of binary-embedded version ([#418](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/418))
* **benchmark:** wrap engine calls in try/catch so one engine failure doesn't prevent the other from running; fix embedding benchmark `disposeModel` leak ([#418](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/418))
* **parser:** add `disposeParsers()` to release cached WASM parsers/queries; call `tree.delete()` after AST analysis to prevent segfaults on repeated builds ([#418](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/418))
* **queries:** hoist prepared statement out of BFS loop in `getClassHierarchy` ([#403](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/403))
* **ci:** only trigger Claude automated review on PR open, not every push ([#419](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/419))

### Performance

* **db:** extract `cachedStmt` utility into `src/db/repository/cached-stmt.js` — reusable prepared statement caching for hot-path repository functions ([#417](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/417), [#402](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/402))

## [3.1.2](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/compare/v3.1.1...v3.1.2) (2026-03-11)

**Phase 3 architectural refactoring reaches substantial completion.** This release finishes the unified AST analysis framework (Phase 3.1) — all four analyses (complexity, CFG, dataflow, AST-store) now run in a single DFS walk via pluggable visitors, with `cfg.js` shrinking from 1,242 to 518 lines and cyclomatic complexity derived directly from CFG structure. CLI command/query separation (Phase 3.2) moves ~1,059 lines of formatting code into a dedicated `src/commands/` directory. Repository pattern migration (Phase 3.3) extracts raw SQL from 14 source modules. Dynamic `import()` expressions are now tracked as `dynamic-imports` graph edges, fixing false positives in dead-export analysis and impact tracing. Prepared statement caching cuts hot-path DB overhead in the repository layer.

### Features

* **ast-analysis:** unified AST analysis framework — shared DFS walker with pluggable `enterNode`/`exitNode`/`enterFunction`/`exitFunction` hooks; complexity, CFG, AST-store, and dataflow visitors in a single coordinated pass ([#388](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/388))
* **cfg:** CFG visitor rewrite — node-level DFS visitor replaces statement-level `buildFunctionCFG`, Mode A/B split eliminated; cyclomatic complexity now derived from CFG (`E - N + 2`); `cfg.js` reduced from 1,242 → 518 lines ([#392](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/392))
* **commands:** extract CLI wrappers into `src/commands/` directory (Phase 3.2) — command/query separation complete across all 19 analysis modules; `src/infrastructure/` added for shared `result-formatter.js` and `test-filter.js` ([#393](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/393))
* **builder:** track dynamic `import()` expressions as `dynamic-imports` graph edges — destructured names feed into call resolution, fixing false "zero consumers" in dead-export analysis ([#389](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/389))

### Bug Fixes

* **hooks:** fix `check-dead-exports` hook silently no-ops on ESM codebases ([#394](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/394))
* **hooks:** guard pre-push hook against `sh -e` failure when `diff-impact` is unavailable
* **complexity:** remove function nodes from `nestingNodeTypes` and eliminate O(n²) lookup
* **complexity:** remove function nesting inflation in `computeAllMetrics` and pass `langId` to LOC
* **ast-analysis:** guard `runAnalyses` call, fix nested function nesting, rename `_engineOpts`
* **ast-analysis:** fix Halstead skip depth counter, debug logging, perf import

### Performance

* **db:** cache prepared statements in hot-path repository functions — avoids repeated statement compilation on incremental builds

### Refactors

* migrate raw SQL from 14 source modules into repository pattern (Phase 3.3) — `src/db/repository/` split into 10 domain files (nodes, edges, build-stmts, complexity, cfg, dataflow, cochange, embeddings, graph-read, barrel)
* address Greptile review — deduplicate `relatedTests`, hoist prepared stmts, fix `.raw()` no-op

## [3.1.1](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/compare/v3.1.0...v3.1.1) (2026-03-08)

**Reliability, architecture, and MCP cold-start fixes.** This patch breaks a circular dependency cycle, fixes MCP server first-connect reliability by deferring heavy imports, corrects flow matching to use core symbol kinds, and refactors all database access to use try/finally for reliable `db.close()`. Internal architecture improves with repository pattern for data access and command/query separation.

### Features

* **hooks:** add pre-commit hooks for cycles, dead exports, signature warnings ([#381](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/381))
* **benchmark:** add 1-file rebuild phase breakdown to build benchmarks ([#370](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/370))

### Bug Fixes

* **cycles:** break circular dependency cycle and remove dead `queryName` export ([#378](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/378))
* **queries:** use `CORE_SYMBOL_KINDS` in flow matching ([#382](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/382))
* **mcp:** defer heavy imports in MCP server for first-connect reliability ([#380](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/380))

### Refactors

* wrap all db usage in try/finally for reliable `db.close()` ([#384](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/384), [#383](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/383))
* repository pattern for data access ([#371](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/371))
* command/query separation — extract CLI wrappers, shared output helper ([#373](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/373))

### Chores

* **ci:** allow `merge` type in commitlint config ([#385](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/385))
* **deps-dev:** bump tree-sitter-go from 0.23.4 to 0.25.0 ([#356](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/356))

## [3.1.0](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/compare/v3.0.4...v3.1.0) (2026-03-08)

**Sequence diagrams, native engine performance leap, and unused export detection.** This release adds `codegraph sequence` for Mermaid sequence diagram generation from call graph edges, delivers major native engine build optimizations (deep-clone elimination, batched SQLite inserts, call edge building in Rust, FS caching, rayon-parallel import resolution), introduces `--unused` on the exports command to detect dead exports, and fixes an ~80x native no-op rebuild regression.

### Features

* **sequence:** add `codegraph sequence <name>` command for Mermaid sequence diagram generation from call graph edges — participants are files, BFS forward from entry point, optional `--dataflow` flag for parameter/return annotations; exposed via CLI, MCP tool, and programmatic API ([#345](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/345))
* **exports:** add `--unused` flag to `codegraph exports` — new `exported` column (migration v14) populated from parser export declarations, enabling detection of symbols declared as exports but with zero consumers ([#361](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/361))

### Performance

* **native:** eliminate deep-clone in `normalizeNativeSymbols` — replace 125-line JS deep-clone with in-place `patchNativeResult` via `#[napi(js_name)]` annotations on Rust types ([#361](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/361))
* **native:** add `include_ast_nodes` flag to `parse_file`/`parse_files` — initial parse skips AST node walking, saving ~200ms ([#361](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/361))
* **native:** move call/receiver/extends edge building to Rust (`edge_builder.rs`) — narrowest-span caller resolution, confidence sorting, dedup via u64 edge keys ([#361](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/361))
* **native:** add `known_files` HashSet cache to `resolve_imports_batch` — avoids redundant FS syscalls during import resolution ([#361](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/361))
* **native:** parallelize `resolve_imports_batch` with rayon for concurrent import resolution ([#361](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/361))
* **builder:** batch SQLite multi-value INSERTs — accumulate node/edge rows and flush with chunked INSERT statements (200 rows per chunk) instead of individual prepared statement runs ([#361](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/361))

### Bug Fixes

* **native:** fix no-op rebuild regression (~80x slower than WASM) — `extToLang` map was not built when native engine provided pre-computed CFG, causing `langId` lookup to return null and triggering full re-parse on every incremental build ([#360](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/360))
* **native:** pass full file list to `known_files` cache — on incremental builds only changed files were passed, causing valid import targets to be dropped ([#361](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/361))
* **benchmark:** install native package explicitly in npm benchmark mode ([#351](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/351))

### Documentation

* reorder README to be AI-first throughout ([#362](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/362))
* add MCP tool surface optimization proposal ([#363](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/363))
* update build performance, query, and incremental benchmarks for 3.0.4 ([#352](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/352), [#353](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/353), [#354](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/354))

### Chores

* **deps:** bump graphology from 0.25.4 to 0.26.0 ([#358](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/358))
* **deps-dev:** bump @biomejs/biome from 2.4.4 to 2.4.6 ([#359](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/359))
* **deps-dev:** bump @commitlint/cli from 20.4.2 to 20.4.3 ([#357](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/357))
* **deps-dev:** bump @commitlint/config-conventional ([#355](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/355))

## [3.0.4](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/compare/v3.0.3...v3.0.4) (2026-03-05)

**Native engine goes full-stack: CFG, AST nodes, and WASM double-parse elimination.** This release completes the native engine migration — CFG computation and AST node extraction now run in Rust for 8 languages, eliminating the redundant WASM pre-parse on native builds.

### Performance

* **native:** compute CFG in Rust native engine for all 8 languages (JS/TS/TSX, Python, Go, Rust, Java, C#, Ruby, PHP) — ports `buildFunctionCFG` algorithm to Rust with per-language `CfgRules`, eliminates WASM re-parsing in CFG phase ([#342](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/342))
* **native:** extract AST nodes (call, new, throw, await, string, regex) for all non-JS languages in Rust via shared `walk_ast_nodes_with_config()` — astMs drops from ~651ms to ~50ms ([#340](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/340))
* **builder:** skip `ensureWasmTrees` entirely when native engine provides complete CFG + dataflow + AST data — wasmPreMs drops from ~388ms to 0 on native builds ([#344](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/344))

### Bug Fixes

* **native:** fix function-scoped `const` declarations being incorrectly extracted as top-level constants ([#344](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/344))
* **benchmark:** show all build phases (astMs, cfgMs, dataflowMs, wasmPreMs) in benchmark report and document v3.0.0→v3.0.3 native regression cause ([#339](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/339))

## [3.0.3](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/compare/v3.0.2...v3.0.3) (2026-03-04)

> **Note:** 3.0.2 was an internal/unpublished version used during development.

### Performance

* **ast:** use single transaction for AST node insertion — astMs drops from ~3600ms to ~350ms (native) and ~547ms (WASM), reducing overall native build from 24.9 to 8.5 ms/file ([#333](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/333))

## [3.0.2](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/compare/v3.0.1...v3.0.2) (2026-03-04)

**Dataflow goes multi-language, build performance recovery, and native engine parity fixes.** This patch extends dataflow analysis from JS/TS-only to all 11 supported languages, recovers build performance lost after CFG/dataflow became default-on, fixes language-aware identifier collection in dataflow, and closes a native engine scoping bug for constants.

### Features

* **dataflow:** extend dataflow analysis to all supported languages (Python, Go, Rust, Java, C#, PHP, Ruby) with per-language `DATAFLOW_RULES` and `makeDataflowRules()` factory ([#318](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/318))

### Bug Fixes

* **dataflow:** use `isIdent` in `collectIdentifiers` for language-aware `referencedNames` — fixes PHP `variable_name` and other non-`identifier` node types being missed in return statements ([#324](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/324))
* **native:** skip local constants inside function bodies — the native JS extractor incorrectly extracted function-scoped `const` as top-level constants ([#327](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/327))
* **native:** enable extended kinds (parameters, properties, constants, receivers) in parity tests and update native binary to v3.0.1 ([#327](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/327))

### Performance

* **builder:** fix v3.0.1 build performance regression (14.1 → ~5.8 ms/file) — eliminate redundant WASM parsing via `ensureWasmTrees()`, memoize `createParsers()`, filter CFG/dataflow to changed files only ([#325](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/325))

### Documentation

* update build performance, query, and incremental benchmarks for 3.0.1 ([#321](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/321), [#322](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/322), [#323](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/323))

## [3.0.1](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/compare/v3.0.0...v3.0.1) (2026-03-03)

**Post-release fixes and dataflow multi-language expansion.** This patch extends dataflow analysis (`flows_to`, `returns`, `mutates` edges) from JS/TS-only to all 11 supported languages, enables `--cfg` and `--dataflow` by default on builds, closes several native/WASM engine parity gaps, and fixes miscellaneous issues found during v3.0.0 dogfooding.

### Features

## [3.0.0](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/compare/v2.6.0...v3.0.0) (2026-03-03)

**Dataflow analysis, intraprocedural CFG, AST node storage, expanded node/edge types, and a streamlined CLI surface.** This release introduces three new analysis dimensions — dataflow tracking (`flows_to`, `returns`, `mutates` edges), intraprocedural control flow graphs for all 11 supported languages, and stored queryable AST nodes (calls, `new`, string, regex, throw, await). The type system expands with `parameter`, `property`, and `constant` node kinds plus `contains`, `parameter_of`, and `receiver` edge kinds, enabling structural queries without reading source. Export gains GraphML, GraphSON, and Neo4j CSV formats plus an interactive HTML viewer (`codegraph plot`). A stable `normalizeSymbol` utility standardizes JSON output across all commands. The CLI surface is streamlined by consolidating redundant commands into fewer, more capable ones.

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **mcp:** MCP tools `fn_deps`, `symbol_path`, and `list_entry_points` removed — use `query` with `deps`/`path` modes and `execution_flow` with `list` mode instead ([d874aa5](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/commit/d874aa5))
* **cli:** commands `fn` and `path` removed — use `query` instead; `query --path` replaced by standalone `path <from> <to>` ([d874aa5](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/commit/d874aa5))
* **cli:** commands `batch-query`, `hotspots`, `manifesto`, and `explain` removed — use `batch`, `triage --level`, `check`, and `audit --quick` respectively ([4f08082](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/commit/4f08082))

## [2.6.0](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/compare/v2.5.1...v2.6.0) (2026-03-02)

**CI validation, architecture boundaries, CODEOWNERS, multi-agent support, and incremental build reliability.** This release adds a `check` command for CI validation predicates (complexity, coverage, staleness gates), architecture boundary enforcement via manifesto rules with an onion-architecture preset, CODEOWNERS integration for ownership queries, `codegraph snapshot` for DB backup/restore, hybrid BM25 + semantic search via FTS5, composite `audit` and `triage` commands for risk-driven workflows, and batch querying for multi-agent dispatch. It also fixes several incremental rebuild bugs — EISDIR crashes on directory nodes, dropped barrel-file edges, orphaned complexity rows — and adds configurable drift detection to warn when incremental results diverge from full rebuilds.

## [2.5.1](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/compare/v2.5.0...v2.5.1) (2026-02-28)

**Critical fix: recover missing `branch-compare` command and broken programmatic API.** The `branch-compare` command and its implementation file were never committed in v2.5.0, causing `codegraph branch-compare` to crash and `import('@optave/codegraph')` to fail entirely due to a top-level re-export of the missing module. This patch recovers the full implementation (568 lines), adds an export guard test to prevent regressions, and introduces `--dry-run` for `registry prune`.

### Bug Fixes

* **cli:** recover `branch-compare` implementation — command was registered in cli.js and index.js but `src/branch-compare.js` was never committed, crashing both the CLI command and the entire programmatic API ([2ee10d4](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/commit/2ee10d4), [3d1224d](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/commit/3d1224d))

* **bench:** remove unnecessary `shell: true` from `execFileSync` — minor security hardening ([14d03ce](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/commit/14d03ce))
* **docs:** correct dogfood benchmark data from stale v2.4.0 native binary — native complexity was reported as 2.2x slower than WASM when it's actually 47x faster ([3d1224d](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/commit/3d1224d))
* **skill:** add native binary version check to dogfood benchmark phase to prevent stale binary misreports ([3d1224d](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/commit/3d1224d))

### Testing

* add `index-exports` unit test — validates all re-exports in index.js resolve without `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` ([2ee10d4](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/commit/2ee10d4))
* add `branch-compare` integration tests (7 tests, 192 lines) ([3d1224d](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/commit/3d1224d))

## [2.0.0](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/compare/v1.4.0...v2.0.0) (2026-02-22)

**Phase 2.5 — Multi-Repo MCP & Structural Analysis.** This release adds multi-repo support for AI agents, structural analysis with architectural metrics, and hardens security across the MCP server and SQL layers.

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **parser:** Node kinds now use language-native types — Go structs → `struct`, Rust structs/enums/traits → `struct`/`enum`/`trait`, Java enums → `enum`, C# structs/records/enums → `struct`/`record`/`enum`, PHP traits/enums → `trait`/`enum`, Ruby modules → `module`. Rebuild required: `codegraph build --no-incremental`. ([72535fb](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/commit/72535fba44e56312fb8d5b21e19bdcbec1ea9f5e))
