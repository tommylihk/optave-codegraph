# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. See [commit-and-tag-version](https://github.com/absolute-version/commit-and-tag-version) for commit guidelines.

## [3.0.0](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/compare/v2.6.0...v3.0.0) (2026-03-03)

**Dataflow analysis, intraprocedural CFG, AST node storage, expanded node/edge types, and a streamlined CLI surface.** This release introduces three new analysis dimensions — dataflow tracking (`flows_to`, `returns`, `mutates` edges), intraprocedural control flow graphs for all 11 supported languages, and stored queryable AST nodes (calls, `new`, string, regex, throw, await). The type system expands with `parameter`, `property`, and `constant` node kinds plus `contains`, `parameter_of`, and `receiver` edge kinds, enabling structural queries without reading source. Export gains GraphML, GraphSON, and Neo4j CSV formats plus an interactive HTML viewer (`codegraph plot`). A stable `normalizeSymbol` utility standardizes JSON output across all commands. The CLI surface is streamlined by consolidating redundant commands into fewer, more capable ones.

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **mcp:** MCP tools `fn_deps`, `symbol_path`, and `list_entry_points` removed — use `query` with `deps`/`path` modes and `execution_flow` with `list` mode instead ([d874aa5](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/commit/d874aa5))
* **cli:** commands `fn` and `path` removed — use `query` instead; `query --path` replaced by standalone `path <from> <to>` ([d874aa5](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/commit/d874aa5))
* **cli:** commands `batch-query`, `hotspots`, `manifesto`, and `explain` removed — use `batch`, `triage --level`, `check`, and `audit --quick` respectively ([4f08082](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/commit/4f08082))

### Features

* **cli:** add dataflow analysis — `build --dataflow` extracts `flows_to`, `returns`, `mutates` edges tracking data movement through functions (JS/TS MVP), with `dataflow` command, MCP tool, and batch support ([#254](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/254))
* **cli:** add intraprocedural control flow graph (CFG) — `build --cfg` constructs basic-block CFGs from tree-sitter AST, `cfg` command with text/DOT/Mermaid output ([#274](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/274))
* **cli:** extend CFG to all supported languages — Python, Go, Rust, Java, C#, Ruby, PHP with per-language `CFG_RULES` and cross-language `processIf`/`processSwitch`/`processTryCatch` ([#283](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/283))
* **cli:** add stored queryable AST nodes — persist calls, `new`, string, regex, throw, await nodes in `ast_nodes` table, queryable via `ast` command with SQL GLOB pattern matching ([#279](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/279))
* **cli:** expand node types with `parameter`, `property`, `constant` kinds and `parent_id` column for sub-declaration queries across all 9 WASM extractors ([#270](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/270))
* **cli:** add expanded edge types — `contains` (file→definition, parent→child), `parameter_of` (inverse), `receiver` (method-call dispatch) ([#279](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/279))

## [2.6.0](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/compare/v2.5.1...v2.6.0) (2026-03-02)

**CI validation, architecture boundaries, CODEOWNERS, multi-agent support, and incremental build reliability.** This release adds a `check` command for CI validation predicates (complexity, coverage, staleness gates), architecture boundary enforcement via manifesto rules with an onion-architecture preset, CODEOWNERS integration for ownership queries, `codegraph snapshot` for DB backup/restore, hybrid BM25 + semantic search via FTS5, composite `audit` and `triage` commands for risk-driven workflows, and batch querying for multi-agent dispatch. It also fixes several incremental rebuild bugs — EISDIR crashes on directory nodes, dropped barrel-file edges, orphaned complexity rows — and adds configurable drift detection to warn when incremental results diverge from full rebuilds.

## [2.5.1](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/compare/v2.5.0...v2.5.1) (2026-02-28)

**Critical fix: recover missing `branch-compare` command and broken programmatic API.** The `branch-compare` command and its implementation file were never committed in v2.5.0, causing `codegraph branch-compare` to crash and `import('@optave/codegraph')` to fail entirely due to a top-level re-export of the missing module. This patch recovers the full implementation (568 lines), adds an export guard test to prevent regressions, and introduces `--dry-run` for `registry prune`.

### Bug Fixes

* **cli:** recover `branch-compare` implementation — command was registered in cli.js and index.js but `src/branch-compare.js` was never committed, crashing both the CLI command and the entire programmatic API ([2ee10d4](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/commit/2ee10d4), [3d1224d](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/commit/3d1224d))
* **registry:** add `--dry-run` flag to `registry prune` — preview what would be removed without deleting entries ([2ee10d4](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/commit/2ee10d4))
* **bench:** remove unnecessary `shell: true` from `execFileSync` — minor security hardening ([14d03ce](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/commit/14d03ce))
* **docs:** correct dogfood benchmark data from stale v2.4.0 native binary — native complexity was reported as 2.2x slower than WASM when it's actually 47x faster ([3d1224d](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/commit/3d1224d))
* **skill:** add native binary version check to dogfood benchmark phase to prevent stale binary misreports ([3d1224d](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/commit/3d1224d))

### Testing

* add `index-exports` unit test — validates all re-exports in index.js resolve without `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` ([2ee10d4](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/commit/2ee10d4))
* add `branch-compare` integration tests (7 tests, 192 lines) ([3d1224d](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/commit/3d1224d))
* add `registry prune --dry-run` unit tests ([2ee10d4](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/commit/2ee10d4))

## [2.4.0](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/compare/v2.3.0...v2.4.0) (2026-02-25)

**Co-change analysis, node roles, faster parsing, and richer Mermaid output.** This release adds git co-change analysis to surface files that change together, classifies nodes by architectural role (entry/core/utility/adapter/dead/leaf), replaces the manual AST walk with tree-sitter's Query API for significantly faster JS/TS/TSX extraction, and enhances Mermaid export with subgraphs, edge labels, node shapes, and styling.

## [2.0.0](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/compare/v1.4.0...v2.0.0) (2026-02-22)

**Phase 2.5 — Multi-Repo MCP & Structural Analysis.** This release adds multi-repo support for AI agents, structural analysis with architectural metrics, and hardens security across the MCP server and SQL layers.

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **parser:** Node kinds now use language-native types — Go structs → `struct`, Rust structs/enums/traits → `struct`/`enum`/`trait`, Java enums → `enum`, C# structs/records/enums → `struct`/`record`/`enum`, PHP traits/enums → `trait`/`enum`, Ruby modules → `module`. Rebuild required: `codegraph build --no-incremental`. ([72535fb](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/commit/72535fba44e56312fb8d5b21e19bdcbec1ea9f5e))
