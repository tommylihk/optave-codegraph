# Titan RUN — End-to-End Pipeline Orchestrator

You are the **orchestrator** for the full Titan Paradigm pipeline. Your job is to dispatch each phase to a **sub-agent** (fresh context window), **validate the results**, and loop phases that require multiple invocations — all without human intervention.

> **You are lightweight.** You do NOT run codegraph commands, audit files, or make code changes yourself. You only: (1) spawn sub-agents, (2) read and validate state files, (3) decide what to run next.

**Arguments** (from `$ARGUMENTS`):
- No args → full pipeline from scratch, target `.`
- `<path>` → target path (passed to recon)
- `--skip-recon` → skip recon (assumes artifacts exist)
- `--skip-gauntlet` → skip gauntlet (assumes artifacts exist)
- `--start-from <phase>` → jump to phase: `recon`, `gauntlet`, `sync`, `forge`, `grind`, `parity`, `close`
- `--gauntlet-batch-size <N>` → batch size for gauntlet (default: 5)
- `--yes` → skip all confirmation prompts in the orchestrator (pre-pipeline, forge checkpoint, and resume prompts) and in forge (per-phase confirmation)

---

## Step 0 — Pre-flight

1. **Worktree check:**
   ```bash
   git rev-parse --show-toplevel && git worktree list
   ```
   The Titan pipeline writes artifacts and makes code changes — worktree isolation is required. If you are NOT in a worktree, **create one automatically** using the `EnterWorktree` tool (fetch it via `ToolSearch` if needed) with name `titan-run`. Do NOT stop and ask the user — just enter the worktree and continue.

2. **Parse arguments.** Determine:
   - `targetPath` (default: `.`)
   - `startPhase` (default: `recon`)
   - `gauntletBatchSize` (default: `5`)
   - `autoConfirm` → `true` if `--yes` is present, otherwise `false`

3. **Check existing state.** Read `.codegraph/titan/titan-state.json` if it exists.
   - If state exists and `--start-from` not specified, ask user: "Existing Titan state found (phase: `<currentPhase>`). Resume from current state, or start fresh with `/titan-reset` first?"
   - If `--yes` is set, resume automatically.

   **Initialize the phase timestamps helper.** Throughout the pipeline, you will record wall-clock timestamps for each phase. Use this helper to write them into `titan-state.json`:

   ```bash
   # Record phase start (safe for resume — only sets startedAt if not already present):
   node -e "const fs=require('fs');const s=JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('.codegraph/titan/titan-state.json','utf8'));s.phaseTimestamps=s.phaseTimestamps||{};s.phaseTimestamps['<PHASE>']=s.phaseTimestamps['<PHASE>']||{};if(!s.phaseTimestamps['<PHASE>'].startedAt){s.phaseTimestamps['<PHASE>'].startedAt=new Date().toISOString();fs.writeFileSync('.codegraph/titan/titan-state.json',JSON.stringify(s,null,2));}"

   # Record phase completion:
   node -e "const fs=require('fs');const s=JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('.codegraph/titan/titan-state.json','utf8'));s.phaseTimestamps=s.phaseTimestamps||{};s.phaseTimestamps['<PHASE>']=s.phaseTimestamps['<PHASE>']||{};s.phaseTimestamps['<PHASE>'].completedAt=new Date().toISOString();fs.writeFileSync('.codegraph/titan/titan-state.json',JSON.stringify(s,null,2));"
   ```

   Replace `<PHASE>` with `recon`, `gauntlet`, `sync`, `forge`, `grind`, `parity`, or `close`. **Run the start command immediately before dispatching each phase's first sub-agent, and the completion command immediately after post-phase validation passes.** If resuming a phase (e.g., gauntlet loop iteration 2+), do NOT overwrite `startedAt` — only set it if it doesn't already exist.

   **Timestamp validation:** After recording `completedAt` for any phase, verify `startedAt < completedAt`:
   ```bash
   node -e "const s=JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('.codegraph/titan/titan-state.json','utf8'));const p=s.phaseTimestamps?.['<PHASE>'];if(p?.startedAt&&p?.completedAt){const start=new Date(p.startedAt),end=new Date(p.completedAt);if(end<=start){console.log('WARNING: <PHASE> completedAt ('+p.completedAt+') is not after startedAt ('+p.startedAt+')');process.exit(0);}console.log('<PHASE> duration: '+((end-start)/60000).toFixed(1)+' min');}else{console.log('WARNING: <PHASE> missing startedAt or completedAt');}"
   ```
   If the check fails, log a warning but do not stop the pipeline — clock skew or immediate completion of short phases can cause this.

4. **Install latest codegraph** (once, before any sub-agent runs):
   ```bash
   npm install -g @optave/codegraph@latest
   ```
   Log the installed version:
   ```bash
   codegraph --version
   ```
   If the install fails, warn the user but continue with whichever version is currently available.

5. **Sync with main** (once, before any sub-agent runs):
   ```bash
   git fetch origin main && git merge origin/main --no-edit
   ```
   If merge conflict → stop: "Merge conflict after syncing with main. Resolve conflicts and re-run `/titan-run`."

6. **Bootstrap worktree environment** (run when `pwd` contains `.claude/worktrees/` or `node_modules` is absent/stale):

   **E1. Node dependencies:** Check whether `node_modules` needs installing:
   ```bash
   if [ ! -f node_modules/.package-lock.json ] || [ package.json -nt node_modules/.package-lock.json ]; then
     npm install --prefer-offline 2>&1 | tail -5
   fi
   ```
   This also builds WASM grammars (via the `prepare` script). After this step, all subsequent agent prompts must use `TEST_CMD="npx vitest run --config vitest.config.worktree.ts"` (see E2).

   **E2. Vitest worktree config:** The default `vitest.config.ts` excludes `**/.claude/**`, matching this path and silently breaking test discovery. Write an override if absent:
   ```bash
   if [ ! -f vitest.config.worktree.ts ]; then
     node -e "
       const fs = require('fs');
       const src = fs.readFileSync('vitest.config.ts', 'utf8');
       fs.writeFileSync('vitest.config.worktree.ts',
         src.replace(/'\*\*\/\.claude\/\*\*',?\s*/g, ''));
       console.log('vitest.config.worktree.ts written');
     "
   fi
   ```
   All test runs in forge/grind/gate agent prompts must reference this file: `npx vitest run --config vitest.config.worktree.ts`.

   **E3. Native binary freshness** (only if `crates/` exists):
   ```bash
   NODE_BINARY=$(find node_modules/@optave -name "codegraph-core.node" 2>/dev/null | head -1)
   if [ -n "$NODE_BINARY" ]; then
     NEWER_RUST=$(find crates -name "*.rs" -newer "$NODE_BINARY" 2>/dev/null | head -1)
     if [ -n "$NEWER_RUST" ]; then
       echo "Rust source newer than binary — rebuilding native addon..."
       npx napi build --platform --release --manifest-path crates/codegraph-core/Cargo.toml --output-dir .
       PLATFORM=$(node -e "const os=require('os');const arch=os.arch()==='arm64'?'arm64':'x64';console.log(os.platform()+'-'+arch)")
       codesign --sign - --force codegraph-core.node 2>/dev/null || true
       cp codegraph-core.node "node_modules/@optave/codegraph-${PLATFORM}/codegraph-core.node"
       echo "Native binary rebuilt."
     fi
   fi
   ```
   If any bootstrap step fails, warn but continue — the pipeline can still proceed, and forge/grind agents will catch environment issues at test-run time.

7. **Print plan:**
   ```
   Titan Pipeline — End-to-End Run
   Target: <path>
   Starting from: <phase>
   Gauntlet batch size: <N>

   Phases: recon → gauntlet (loop) → sync → [PAUSE] → forge (loop) → grind (loop) → close
   Each phase runs in a sub-agent with a fresh context window.
   Forge requires explicit confirmation (analysis phases are safe to automate).
   Grind runs after forge to adopt extracted helpers into consumers.
   ```

   Start immediately — do NOT ask for confirmation before analysis phases. The user invoked `/titan-run`; that is the confirmation. Analysis phases (recon, gauntlet, sync) are read-only and safe to automate. The forge checkpoint (Step 3.5b) still applies unless `--yes` is set.

---

## Pre-Agent Gate (run before EVERY sub-agent dispatch)

Before spawning any sub-agent, run these checks. This catches git state drift, concurrent interference, and corruption left by a crashed agent.

### G1. Git health check
```bash
git status --porcelain
```
- **Unexpected dirty files** (files not in `.codegraph/titan/`): Print warning with the file list. Ask user to confirm proceeding, or stop. If `--yes`, log the warning and continue — but do NOT stage or commit these files.
- **Merge conflicts** (lines starting with `UU`, `AA`, `DD`, `AU`, `UA`, `DU`, `UD`): Stop immediately: "Unresolved merge conflict detected. Resolve before continuing."

### G2. Worktree still valid
```bash
git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree
```
If this fails (worktree was pruned or moved), stop: "Worktree is no longer valid. Create a new one with `/worktree`."

### G3. State file integrity
If `.codegraph/titan/titan-state.json` should exist at this point (i.e., we're past recon):
```bash
node -e "try { JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('.codegraph/titan/titan-state.json','utf8')); console.log('OK'); } catch(e) { console.log('CORRUPT: '+e.message); process.exit(1); }"
```
- If **CORRUPT** → attempt recovery from backup:
  1. Check if `.codegraph/titan/titan-state.json.bak` exists.
  2. If the backup exists, validate it is valid JSON:
     ```bash
     node -e "try { JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('.codegraph/titan/titan-state.json.bak','utf8')); console.log('BACKUP OK'); } catch(e) { console.log('BACKUP CORRUPT: '+e.message); process.exit(1); }"
     ```
  3. If the backup is valid → restore it: `cp .codegraph/titan/titan-state.json.bak .codegraph/titan/titan-state.json`
  4. If the backup is also corrupt or missing → stop: "State file corrupted with no valid backup. Run `/titan-reset` and start over."

### G4. State backup
Before every sub-agent dispatch, back up the current state file:
```bash
cp .codegraph/titan/titan-state.json .codegraph/titan/titan-state.json.bak 2>/dev/null || true
```
If a sub-agent corrupts the state, G3 on the next iteration will detect it and restore from `.bak`.

---

## Step 0.5 — Artifact pre-validation (phase skip)

**Run this step if `--start-from` was specified, `--skip-recon` is set, or `--skip-gauntlet` is set.** Any of these flags cause phases to be skipped — their artifacts must exist and be valid before proceeding. When `--skip-recon` is set, validate recon artifacts. When `--skip-gauntlet` is set, validate both recon and gauntlet artifacts.

For each phase BEFORE `startPhase`, run the corresponding V-checks:

| Skipped phase | Required artifacts + checks |
|---------------|-----------------------------|
| `recon` | V1 structural fields only (domains, batches, priorityQueue, stats — skip `currentPhase == "recon"` check since later phases advance it), V2 (GLOBAL_ARCH.md), V3 (snapshot exists — WARN if missing), V4 (cross-check counts) |
| `gauntlet` | V5 (coverage ≥ 50%), V6 (entry completeness sample), V7 (summary consistency); also run NDJSON integrity check (2c) |
| `sync` | V8 (sync.json structure), V9 (targets trace to gauntlet), V10 (dependency order) |
| `forge` | V14 (final state consistency), V15 (gate log consistency); execution block must exist in titan-state.json |
| `grind` | V14, V15; `execution.completedPhases` must be non-empty in titan-state.json (forge must have run at least one phase) |

If ANY required artifact is **missing** → stop: "Cannot start from `<phase>` — `<artifact>` is missing. Run the full pipeline or start from an earlier phase."

If ANY V-check that is normally VALIDATION FAILED would fail → stop with the same message as it would during normal execution.

WARN-level V-checks from skipped phases are surfaced as prefixed warnings: "[skipped-phase pre-validation] <warning text>" — they do not stop the pipeline.

---

## Step 1 — RECON

**Skip if:** `--skip-recon`, `--start-from` is after recon, or `titan-state.json` already has `currentPhase` beyond `"recon"`.

### 1a. Run Pre-Agent Gate (G1-G4)

### 1a.1. Record phase start timestamp
Record `phaseTimestamps.recon.startedAt` (only if not already set — it may exist from a prior crashed run).

**Note:** On a fresh run, `titan-state.json` does not yet exist (titan-recon creates it in Step 12). Use this safe variant that creates a minimal stub if the file is missing:

```bash
node -e "const fs=require('fs');const p='.codegraph/titan/titan-state.json';let s;try{s=JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(p,'utf8'));}catch{fs.mkdirSync('.codegraph/titan',{recursive:true});s={};}s.phaseTimestamps=s.phaseTimestamps||{};s.phaseTimestamps['recon']=s.phaseTimestamps['recon']||{};if(!s.phaseTimestamps['recon'].startedAt){s.phaseTimestamps['recon'].startedAt=new Date().toISOString();fs.writeFileSync(p,JSON.stringify(s,null,2));}"
```

This ensures `recon.startedAt` is recorded even on first-time runs. titan-recon Step 12 merges any existing `phaseTimestamps` into the full state file it writes.

### 1b. Dispatch sub-agent

Use the **Agent tool** to spawn a sub-agent:

```
prompt: |
  You are running the Titan RECON phase. Read and follow the skill file at
  .claude/skills/titan-recon/SKILL.md exactly. Target path: <targetPath>.

  IMPORTANT: Skip the worktree check (Step 0.1) — the orchestrator already verified this.
  IMPORTANT: Skip the "sync with main" step (Step 0.2) — the orchestrator already did this.
  Execute Steps 1-13 as documented.
```

### 1c. Post-phase validation

After the agent returns, validate the artifacts:

**V1. titan-state.json structure:**
Read `.codegraph/titan/titan-state.json` and verify ALL of these fields exist and are non-empty:
- `version` — must be a number
- `initialized` — must be an ISO 8601 string
- `currentPhase` — must equal `"recon"`
- `stats.totalNodes` — must be > 0
- `stats.totalEdges` — must be > 0
- `stats.totalFiles` — must be > 0
- `domains` — must be an array with length > 0
- `batches` — must be an array with length > 0
- `priorityQueue` — must be an array with length > 0

If any field is missing, zero, or wrong type → **VALIDATION FAILED.** Print which fields failed and stop: "RECON produced incomplete state. Re-run with `/titan-run --start-from recon`."

**V2. GLOBAL_ARCH.md exists and has content:**
Read `.codegraph/titan/GLOBAL_ARCH.md`:
- Must exist
- Must contain `## Domain Map` heading
- Must have > 10 lines

If missing or empty → **VALIDATION FAILED.**

**V3. Snapshot created:**
```bash
codegraph snapshot list 2>/dev/null | grep titan-baseline || echo "NO_SNAPSHOT"
```
If `NO_SNAPSHOT` → **WARN** (not fatal, but note it: "No baseline snapshot — rollback in GATE will not work").

**V4. Cross-check counts:**
- `titan-state.json → stats.totalFiles` should roughly match the number of targets across all batches (batches are subsets of files, so `sum(batch.files.length)` should be ≤ `totalFiles`)
- `priorityQueue.length` should be > 0 and ≤ `totalNodes`
- **Batch size check:** Every batch must have ≤ 5 files. If any batch exceeds 5, **WARN**: "Batch <id> has <N> files (max 5). Large batches cause context overload in gauntlet sub-agents."

If wildly inconsistent (e.g., 0 batches but 500 nodes) → **WARN** with details.

Print: `RECON validated. Domains: <count>, Batches: <count>, Priority targets: <count>, Quality score: <score>`

Record `phaseTimestamps.recon.completedAt`.

---

## Step 2 — GAUNTLET (loop)

**Skip if:** `--skip-gauntlet` or `--start-from` is after gauntlet.

### 2a. Pre-loop check

Record `phaseTimestamps.gauntlet.startedAt` (only if not already set — gauntlet may be resuming).

Read `.codegraph/titan/gauntlet-summary.json` if it exists:
- If `"complete": true` → run gauntlet post-validation (2d) and skip loop if it passes
- Otherwise, count completed batches from `titan-state.json` for progress tracking

Compute `expectedTargetCount` from `titan-state.json → priorityQueue.length` (or sum of batch file counts). This is the ground truth for "how many targets should gauntlet audit."

### 2b. Gauntlet loop

Set `maxIterations = 50` (safety limit).
Set `stallCount = 0`, `maxStalls = 3` (consecutive no-progress iterations before abort).

```
previousAuditedCount = titan-state.json → progress.audited (or 0)
iteration = 0

while iteration < maxIterations:
    iteration += 1

    # Run Pre-Agent Gate (G1-G4)

    # Dispatch sub-agent
    Agent → "Run /titan-gauntlet with batch size <N>.
             Read .claude/skills/titan-gauntlet/SKILL.md and follow it exactly.
             Batch size: <gauntletBatchSize>.
             Skip worktree check and main sync — already handled.
             Process as many batches as context allows, then save state and stop."

    # Check completion
    Read .codegraph/titan/gauntlet-summary.json (if exists)
    if "complete": true → break

    # Progress tracking
    Read .codegraph/titan/titan-state.json
    currentAuditedCount = progress.audited

    if currentAuditedCount == previousAuditedCount:
        stallCount += 1
        Print: "WARNING: Gauntlet iteration <iteration> made no progress (stall <stallCount>/<maxStalls>)"
        if stallCount >= maxStalls:
            Stop: "Gauntlet stalled for <maxStalls> consecutive iterations at <currentAuditedCount>/<expectedTargetCount> targets. Likely stuck on a problematic target. Check gauntlet.ndjson for the last successful entry and investigate the next target in the batch."
    else:
        stallCount = 0  # reset on any progress

    countBeforeUpdate = previousAuditedCount
    previousAuditedCount = currentAuditedCount

    # Efficiency check: if progress is very slow (< 2 targets per iteration), warn
    # Only fire when stallCount == 0 — if stalled, the stall warning already covers it
    targetsThisIteration = currentAuditedCount - countBeforeUpdate
    if targetsThisIteration == 1 and iteration > 3 and stallCount == 0:
        Print: "WARNING: Only 1 target per iteration — agent may be spending too much context. Consider increasing batch size."

    Print: "Gauntlet iteration <iteration>: <currentAuditedCount>/<expectedTargetCount> targets audited"
```

### 2c. NDJSON integrity check

After the loop completes (or on each iteration if you prefer lightweight checks):

```bash
node -e "
const fs = require('fs');
const path = '.codegraph/titan/gauntlet.ndjson';
if (!fs.existsSync(path)) {
  console.log(JSON.stringify({ valid: 0, corrupt: 0, total: 0, missing: true }));
  process.exit(0);
}
const lines = fs.readFileSync(path,'utf8').trim().split('\n');
let valid = 0, corrupt = 0;
for (const line of lines) {
  try { JSON.parse(line); valid++; } catch { corrupt++; }
}
console.log(JSON.stringify({ valid, corrupt, total: lines.length, missing: false }));
"
```

- If `missing == true`: treat as equivalent to `valid == 0` — the file does not exist yet (expected on first iteration, error if the loop should have produced entries).
- If `corrupt > 0`: Print "WARNING: <corrupt> corrupt lines in gauntlet.ndjson (likely from a crashed sub-agent). These targets may need re-auditing."
- If `valid == 0` and `missing == false`: Stop: "gauntlet.ndjson has no valid entries. Something went wrong."

### 2d. Post-loop validation

**V5. Gauntlet coverage:**
- Count distinct `target` values in `gauntlet.ndjson` (valid lines only)
- Compare against `expectedTargetCount`
- If coverage < 80%: **WARN** "Gauntlet only audited <N>/<M> targets (<pct>%). Consider re-running with `/titan-run --start-from gauntlet`."
- If coverage < 50%: **VALIDATION FAILED.** Stop.

**V6. Gauntlet entry completeness (sample check):**
Read first 5 and last 5 entries from `gauntlet.ndjson`. Each entry MUST have:
- `target` — non-empty string
- `file` — non-empty string
- `verdict` — one of `PASS`, `WARN`, `FAIL`, `DECOMPOSE`
- `pillarVerdicts` — object with keys `I`, `II`, `III`, `IV`
- `metrics` — object with at least `cognitive` and `cyclomatic` (numeric)
- `violations` — array

If any sampled entry is missing required fields → **WARN**: "Gauntlet entry for <target> is incomplete — sub-agent may have skipped rules. Fields missing: <list>."

**V7. Summary consistency:**
Read `gauntlet-summary.json`:
- `summary.totalAudited` should equal the valid NDJSON line count
- `summary.pass + summary.warn + summary.fail + summary.decompose` should equal `summary.totalAudited`

If mismatched → **WARN** with details (not fatal — the NDJSON is the source of truth, summary is derived).

Print: `GAUNTLET validated. Audited: <N>/<M> targets. Pass: <N>, Warn: <N>, Fail: <N>, Decompose: <N>. NDJSON integrity: <valid>/<total> lines OK.`

Record `phaseTimestamps.gauntlet.completedAt`.

---

## Step 3 — SYNC

**Skip if:** `--start-from` is after sync, or `titan-state.json` has `currentPhase: "sync"` with existing `sync.json`.

### 3a. Run Pre-Agent Gate (G1-G4)

### 3a.1. Record phase start timestamp
Record `phaseTimestamps.sync.startedAt`.

### 3b. Dispatch sub-agent

```
Agent → "Run /titan-sync. Read .claude/skills/titan-sync/SKILL.md and follow it exactly.
         Skip worktree check and main sync — already handled.
         Read GAUNTLET artifacts and produce sync.json."
```

### 3c. Post-phase validation

**Pre-V8. Validate sync.json is parseable JSON:**
```bash
node -e "try { JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('.codegraph/titan/sync.json','utf8')); console.log('JSON OK'); } catch(e) { console.log('JSON INVALID: '+e.message); process.exit(1); }"
```
If this fails → **VALIDATION FAILED.** Stop: "SYNC produced invalid JSON in sync.json (likely a mismatched bracket/brace). Re-run with `/titan-run --start-from sync`."

**V8. sync.json structure:**
Read `.codegraph/titan/sync.json` and verify:
- `phase` — must equal `"sync"`
- `executionOrder` — must be an array with length > 0
- Each entry in `executionOrder` must have: `phase` (number), `label` (string), `targets` (array), `commit` (string)
- `executionOrder` phases must be in ascending order
- No duplicate phase numbers

If missing or structurally invalid → **VALIDATION FAILED.** Stop: "SYNC produced invalid plan. Re-run with `/titan-run --start-from sync`."

**V9. Sync targets trace back to gauntlet batches:**
Collect all file paths from `titan-state.json → batches[*].files` (the ground-truth set gauntlet audited).
Flatten all targets from `sync.json → executionOrder[*].targets` and check each against that set.

```javascript
const state = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('.codegraph/titan/titan-state.json','utf8'));
const batchFiles = new Set((state.batches || []).flatMap(b => b.files || []));
const allSyncTargets = sync.executionOrder.flatMap(e => e.targets);
if (allSyncTargets.length === 0) { console.log('V9 FAIL: sync.json has no targets — execution plan is empty'); process.exit(1); }
const missingCount = allSyncTargets.filter(t => !batchFiles.has(t)).length;
const pct = missingCount / allSyncTargets.length;
if (pct > 0.2) console.log('V9 WARN:', missingCount + '/' + allSyncTargets.length,
  'sync targets not in any gauntlet batch (' + (pct*100).toFixed(0) + '%) — agent may have hallucinated targets');
else console.log('V9 OK —', allSyncTargets.length, 'targets, all traced to gauntlet batches');
```

Note: sync targets are **file-level paths** (`src/foo.ts`). Do NOT compare against `gauntlet.ndjson → target` fields — those are function-level names and will never match.

**V10. Execution order dependency check:**
For entries with `dependencies` arrays, verify that each dependency phase number exists in `executionOrder` and has a lower phase number. Circular dependencies in the execution plan → **VALIDATION FAILED.**

Print: `SYNC validated. Execution phases: <N>, Total targets: <N>, Estimated commits: <N>.`

Record `phaseTimestamps.sync.completedAt`.

---

## Step 3.5 — Pre-forge: Architectural Snapshot + Human Checkpoint

**Skip if:** `--start-from` is `forge` AND `.codegraph/titan/arch-snapshot.json` already exists. The existing snapshot is the correct pre-forge baseline — re-capturing it mid-forge would overwrite it with a state that already includes prior forge commits, making gate A1/A3 comparisons inaccurate.

If `--start-from forge` is used **without** an existing snapshot, run Step 3.5a normally (captures a pre-forge baseline from the current committed state).

### 3.5a. Capture architectural snapshot

Before any code changes, snapshot the codebase's architectural properties. This becomes the baseline for the architectural comparator in `/titan-gate` (Step 5.5).

```bash
codegraph communities -T --json > .codegraph/titan/arch-snapshot-communities.json
codegraph structure --depth 2 --json > .codegraph/titan/arch-snapshot-structure.json
codegraph communities --drift -T --json > .codegraph/titan/arch-snapshot-drift.json
```

Combine into a single snapshot file:

```bash
TITAN_HEAD_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
node -e "
const fs = require('fs');
try {
  const communities = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('.codegraph/titan/arch-snapshot-communities.json','utf8'));
  const structure = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('.codegraph/titan/arch-snapshot-structure.json','utf8'));
  const drift = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('.codegraph/titan/arch-snapshot-drift.json','utf8'));
  const snapshot = {
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    capturedBefore: 'forge',
    headSha: '$TITAN_HEAD_SHA',
    communities,
    structure,
    drift
  };
  fs.writeFileSync('.codegraph/titan/arch-snapshot.json', JSON.stringify(snapshot, null, 2));
} catch (e) {
  console.error('WARNING: Failed to build arch-snapshot.json: ' + e.message);
  console.error('Architectural comparison (titan-gate A1/A3/A4) will be skipped.');
}
"
```

Clean up temp files:
```bash
rm -f .codegraph/titan/arch-snapshot-communities.json .codegraph/titan/arch-snapshot-structure.json .codegraph/titan/arch-snapshot-drift.json
```

This snapshot is read by `/titan-gate` Step 5.5 during every commit validation.

### 3.5b. Human checkpoint

**This is a mandatory pause.** Analysis phases (recon, gauntlet, sync) are read-only. FORGE makes real code changes and commits. The user must see the plan.

First, determine the snapshot status from Step 3.5a:
```
snapshotStatus = file_exists('.codegraph/titan/arch-snapshot.json') ? "captured" : "FAILED — gate A1/A3/A4 will be skipped"
```

**Divergence check** — compute before printing the checkpoint so the warning appears inline:
```bash
if git fetch origin main 2>/dev/null; then
  mergeBase=$(git merge-base HEAD origin/main)
  mainAdvance=$(git rev-list --count $mergeBase..origin/main)
else
  mainAdvance="unknown"
fi
```
```
mainAdvanceNote = mainAdvance == "unknown"
  ? "NOTE: Could not fetch origin/main — skipping divergence check."
  : mainAdvance > 0
    ? "WARNING: main has advanced <mainAdvance> commits since initial sync.\nIf significant, consider re-running: /titan-run --start-from recon"
    : ""
```

Print:
```
================================================================
  ANALYSIS COMPLETE — FORGE CHECKPOINT
================================================================

The analysis phases (recon → gauntlet → sync) are done.
FORGE will now make code changes and commit them.

Execution plan summary:
  Phase 1: <label> — <N> targets
  Phase 2: <label> — <N> targets
  ...

Total: <N> phases, <N> targets, <N> estimated commits

Architectural snapshot: <snapshotStatus>
<mainAdvanceNote>

Validation layers per commit:
  1. Diff Review — does the change match the gauntlet recommendation and sync plan?
  2. Titan Gate — structural checks, semantic assertions, architectural comparison, lint/build/test

Proceed with /titan-forge? [y/n]
(Use --yes to skip this checkpoint in future runs)
================================================================
```

If `--yes` is NOT set: **stop and wait for user confirmation.** Do NOT proceed.
If `--yes` IS set: print the summary but continue automatically.

Once the user confirms (or `--yes` was set), `autoConfirm` is already `true` (set from `--yes` at parse time). If the user confirmed interactively (without `--yes`), set `autoConfirm = true` now — forge sub-agents must receive `--yes` to avoid per-phase confirmation prompts that cannot be answered in a sub-agent context.

---

## Step 4 — FORGE (loop)

### 4a. Pre-loop check

Record `phaseTimestamps.forge.startedAt` (only if not already set — forge may be resuming).

Read `.codegraph/titan/sync.json` → count total phases in `executionOrder`.
Read `.codegraph/titan/titan-state.json` → check `execution.completedPhases` (may not exist yet if forge hasn't started).

If `.codegraph/titan/arch-snapshot.json` does not exist:
  Print: "NOTE: No arch-snapshot.json found. Architectural comparison in /titan-gate (Step 5.5) will be skipped for this run. To enable it, run '/titan-run --start-from sync' to re-capture the pre-forge snapshot."

### 4b. Forge loop

Set `maxIterations = 20` (safety limit).
Set `stallCount = 0`, `maxStalls = 2` (forge stalls are more serious — fewer retries).

```
previousCompletedPhases = execution.completedPhases (or [])
previousCompletedTargets = execution.completedTargets (or [])
previousFailedTargets = execution.failedTargets (or [])
iteration = 0

while iteration < maxIterations:
    iteration += 1

    # Run Pre-Agent Gate (G1-G4) — CRITICAL for forge since it commits
    # Context: show recent commits so agent has context for V12 commit audit
    Print: git log --oneline -5
    # Record the HEAD sha before dispatching

    headBefore = $(git rev-parse HEAD)

    # Determine next phase
    Read .codegraph/titan/titan-state.json
    completedPhases = execution.completedPhases (or [])
    totalPhases = len(sync.json.executionOrder)
    if len(completedPhases) >= totalPhases → break

    nextPhase = first phase number NOT in completedPhases

    # Dispatch sub-agent
    yesFlag = "--yes" if autoConfirm else ""
    Agent → "Run /titan-forge --phase <nextPhase> <yesFlag>.
             Read .claude/skills/titan-forge/SKILL.md and follow it exactly.
             Skip worktree check and main sync — already handled.

             For each target, the validation flow is:
             1. Apply code change
             2. Stage files
             3. Diff review (Step 9 in forge) — verify diff matches gauntlet recommendation and sync plan intent
             4. Run tests
             5. Run /titan-gate — read .claude/skills/titan-gate/SKILL.md and follow it exactly.
                Gate now includes semantic assertions (Step 5) and architectural snapshot comparison (Step 5.5).
                The arch snapshot is at .codegraph/titan/arch-snapshot.json.
             6. Commit on success, rollback on failure

             Do NOT skip the diff review step — it catches intent drift before gate even runs."

    # Post-agent checks
    headAfter = $(git rev-parse HEAD)

    # V11. Verify commits were actually made (unless all targets failed)
    Read .codegraph/titan/titan-state.json
    newCompletedPhases = execution.completedPhases (or [])
    newCompletedTargets = execution.completedTargets (or [])
    newFailedTargets = execution.failedTargets (or [])

                         2. Identify which committed change broke them (git diff <headBefore>..<headAfter>)
                         3. Fix the root cause — prefer targeted fixes over reverts
                         4. If Rust source changed: rebuild the native addon before running tests
                            npx napi build --platform --release --manifest-path crates/codegraph-core/Cargo.toml --output-dir .

                         6. Commit fixes with: 'fix: correct regressions from forge phase <N>'
                         7. Do NOT stage: package-lock.json, vitest.config.worktree.ts, tests/benchmarks/resolution/fixtures/python/__pycache__/

                    Print: "V13: Regressions resolved by fix agent. Continuing pipeline."
```

### 4c. Post-loop validation

**V14. Final state consistency:**
Read `.codegraph/titan/titan-state.json`:
- `execution.completedPhases` should contain all phase numbers from `sync.json → executionOrder`
- `execution.commits` should be an array (may be empty if all targets failed)
- Every commit SHA in `execution.commits` should exist in git log:
  ```bash
  git cat-file -t <sha>
  ```
  If any SHA doesn't exist → **WARN**: "Commit <sha> recorded in state but not found in git history. State may be out of sync."

**V15. Gate log consistency:**
If `.codegraph/titan/gate-log.ndjson` exists:
- Count PASS vs FAIL entries
- Every FAIL entry with `"rolledBack": true` should NOT have a corresponding commit in `execution.commits`

Print forge summary.

Record `phaseTimestamps.forge.completedAt`.

---

## Step 4.5 — GRIND (loop)

Grind runs after forge to close the adoption loop. Forge extracts helpers; grind wires them into consumers and removes dead code. Without grind, the dead symbol count inflates with every forge phase.

**Skip if:** `--start-from` is `parity` or `close`, or `titan-state.json → grind.completedPhases` already covers all forge phases.

### 4.5a. Pre-loop check

Record `phaseTimestamps.grind.startedAt` (only if not already set — grind may be resuming).

Read `.codegraph/titan/sync.json` → count total phases in `executionOrder`.
Read `.codegraph/titan/titan-state.json` → check `grind.completedPhases` (may not exist yet if grind hasn't started).

### 4.5b. Grind loop

Set `maxIterations = 20` (safety limit — same as forge).
Set `stallCount = 0`, `maxStalls = 2`.

```
previousGrindPhases = grind.completedPhases (or [])
iteration = 0

while iteration < maxIterations:
    iteration += 1

    # Run Pre-Agent Gate (G1-G4)

    # Determine next forge phase to grind
    Read .codegraph/titan/titan-state.json
    grindCompleted = grind.completedPhases (or [])
    forgePhases = execution.completedPhases (or [])
    ungroundPhases = forgePhases.filter(p => !grindCompleted.includes(p))
    if len(ungroundPhases) == 0 → break

    nextPhase = ungroundPhases[0]

    headBefore = $(git rev-parse HEAD)

    yesFlag = "--yes" if autoConfirm else ""
    Agent → "Run /titan-grind --phase <nextPhase> <yesFlag>.
             Read .claude/skills/titan-grind/SKILL.md and follow it exactly.
             Skip worktree check and main sync — already handled.

             For each dead helper from forge phase <nextPhase>:
             1. Classify: adopt / re-export / promote / false-positive / intentionally-private / remove
             2. For adopt/re-export/promote: wire consumers, stage, run /titan-gate, commit
             3. For remove: delete, stage, run /titan-gate, commit
             4. Gate on dead-symbol delta at phase end"

    # Post-agent checks
    headAfter = $(git rev-parse HEAD)

    Read .codegraph/titan/titan-state.json
    newGrindPhases = grind.completedPhases (or [])

    if newGrindPhases == previousGrindPhases:
        stallCount += 1
        Print: "WARNING: Grind iteration <iteration> made no progress (stall <stallCount>/<maxStalls>)"
        if stallCount >= maxStalls:

                else:
                    Print: "V17: Regressions resolved by fix agent. Continuing pipeline."
```

### 4.5c. Post-loop validation

**V18. Dead-symbol delta:**
Read `grind.deadSymbolBaseline` and `grind.deadSymbolCurrent` from `titan-state.json`.
- If delta > 10: **WARN** "Grind could not fully adopt forge's helpers. <delta> new dead symbols remain."
- Otherwise: Print summary.

**V19. Grind coverage:**
- Count forge phases processed vs total forge phases
- If < 100%: **WARN** with details

Print grind summary:
```
GRIND complete.
Dead symbols: <baseline> → <current> (delta: <+/-N>)
Adoptions: <N> helpers wired, <N> removed, <N> false positives logged
Phases ground: <N>/<M>
```

Record `phaseTimestamps.grind.completedAt`.

---

## Step 4.6 — PARITY (conditional, repo-provided)

Some repos ship multiple implementations of the same logic that must stay in lockstep (e.g. a dual native/WASM engine, a client and server copy of a validator). Forge and grind edit code across the tree; this step verifies those edits didn't leave one implementation behind.

**titan-run is repo-agnostic** — never assume the target repo has engines, fixtures, or any parity surface. The contract: a repo opts in by shipping its own `/parity` skill at `.claude/skills/parity/SKILL.md` (wrapping whatever audit mechanism it uses internally). No skill → no parity phase.

### 4.6a. Detect the repo's parity mechanism

```bash
test -f .claude/skills/parity/SKILL.md && echo "PARITY SKILL FOUND" || echo "NO PARITY SKILL"
```

- **NO PARITY SKILL** → print `"PARITY skipped — repo provides no /parity skill."` and continue to Step 5. Absence is normal for most repos; do not warn.
- **PARITY SKILL FOUND** → continue below.

**Skip also if:** `--start-from` is `close`, or the pipeline made no code changes this run (`titan-state.json → execution.commits` empty/absent AND no grind adoption commits) — unless `--start-from parity` was given explicitly, which always runs the audit.

### 4.6b. Record phase start

Record `phaseTimestamps.parity.startedAt`.

```bash
headBefore=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
```

### 4.6c. Run Pre-Agent Gate (G1-G4)

### 4.6d. Dispatch sub-agent

```
Agent → "Run /parity. Read .claude/skills/parity/SKILL.md and follow it exactly.
         Skip worktree check — already handled.
         Audit every surface the skill covers. Fix any divergence introduced by
         recent commits at the root cause, commit the fixes, and re-verify until
         the audit is clean. If a divergence pre-dates this run (verify via
         git log on the relevant files), follow the skill's and repo's rules for
         pre-existing findings (typically: file an issue, don't expand scope)."
```

### 4.6e. Post-phase validation

After the agent returns:

```bash
headAfter=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
```

- `git status --short` → the working tree must be clean. The sub-agent commits its fixes; uncommitted changes mean it stopped mid-fix → **stop** and report.
- If the agent fixed divergences, run V16-style commit audit: `git log --oneline $headBefore..$headAfter` and print the parity-fix commits.
- If the agent reports divergences introduced by THIS run that it could not fix → **stop**: "PARITY failed — this run introduced implementation drift. Fix before CLOSE or revert the offending commits." Pre-existing divergences filed as issues are not blockers; print the issue URLs.

Print: `"PARITY complete: <clean | N divergences fixed | N pre-existing filed as issues>"`

Record `phaseTimestamps.parity.completedAt`.

---

## Step 5 — CLOSE (report + PRs)

After forge completes, dispatch `/titan-close` to produce the final report with before/after metrics and split commits into focused PRs.

### 5a. Run Pre-Agent Gate (G1-G4)

### 5a.1. Record phase start timestamp
Record `phaseTimestamps.close.startedAt`.

### 5b. Dispatch sub-agent

```
Agent → "Run /titan-close. Read .claude/skills/titan-close/SKILL.md and follow it exactly.
         Skip worktree check and main sync — already handled."
```

### 5c. Post-phase validation

After the agent returns, verify:
- `.codegraph/titan/TITAN_REPORT.md` or `generated/titan/titan-report-*.md` exists and has content (> 20 lines)
- Print: "CLOSE complete. Report: <report path>"

If the agent created PRs, print the PR URLs.

**Commit hygiene check:** If `.claude/skills/` files were modified during this run (e.g., by a V13 regression-fix agent), they must NOT share a commit with `.codegraph/titan/` artifacts. Check:
```bash
git status --short | grep -E "\.claude/skills/|generated/titan/|\.codegraph/titan/"
```
If both are dirty, commit them separately before proceeding to the retrospective.

Record `phaseTimestamps.close.completedAt`.

---

## Step 6 — RETROSPECTIVE (automatic)

After CLOSE, run a brief retrospective on this pipeline execution and offer to apply findings as skill improvements.

### 6a. Collect run data

Read from disk (no sub-agent needed):
```bash
node -e "
const fs = require('fs');
const s = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('.codegraph/titan/titan-state.json','utf8'));
const ts = s.phaseTimestamps || {};
const phases = ['recon','gauntlet','sync','forge','grind','parity','close'];
for (const p of phases) {
  if (ts[p]?.startedAt && ts[p]?.completedAt) {
    const dur = ((new Date(ts[p].completedAt) - new Date(ts[p].startedAt))/60000).toFixed(1);
    console.log(p + ': ' + dur + ' min');
  }
}
const stalls = s.gauntletStalls || 0;
const forgeStalls = s.execution?.stallCount || 0;
const failed = (s.execution?.failedTargets || []).length;
const grindDelta = (s.grind?.deadSymbolCurrent || 0) - (s.grind?.deadSymbolBaseline || 0);
console.log('gauntlet stalls:', stalls, '| forge stalls:', forgeStalls, '| failed targets:', failed, '| grind delta:', grindDelta);
"
```

### 6b. Dispatch retrospective agent

```
Agent → "Analyze this Titan pipeline run and produce a retrospective.

Read:
  - .codegraph/titan/titan-state.json  (phase timestamps, stalls, failed targets)
  - .codegraph/titan/gate-log.ndjson   (PASS/WARN/FAIL verdicts per commit)
  - .codegraph/titan/gauntlet-summary.json
  - .codegraph/titan/issues.ndjson     (bugs and anomalies logged during the run)

Produce a JSON file at .codegraph/titan/retrospective.json:
{
  'wentWell': [string],       // phases/outcomes that ran cleanly
  'anomalies': [              // anything that required retries, fixes, or manual intervention
    { phase: string, description: string }
  ],
  'skillRecs': [              // concrete skill improvements, highest-impact first
    { priority: 'P1'|'P2'|'P3', area: string, problem: string, fix: string }
  ]
}

Keep skillRecs to 3-5 items max. Focus on structural issues (things that would affect every run), not one-off incidents."
```

### 6c. Print retrospective summary

After the agent writes `retrospective.json`, read and print it:
```bash
node -e "

### 6d. Offer skill improvement

Ask the user:
```
Would you like me to apply these recommendations to improve the /titan-run skill? [y/n]
```

If `--yes` is set → apply automatically without asking.

**If yes (or --yes):**

Run Pre-Agent Gate (G1-G4), back up state, then:

```
Agent → "Improve .claude/skills/titan-run/SKILL.md based on these recommendations:
         <paste skillRecs from retrospective.json>

         Rules:
         - Use the Edit tool — make targeted changes only, do not rewrite unrelated sections
         - One logical change per edit call
         - After editing, verify the file is internally consistent (read the changed sections)
         - Commit with: 'fix(titan-run): <one-line summary of improvements applied>'
         - Do NOT stage: package-lock.json, vitest.config.worktree.ts, .codegraph/titan/"
```

**If no:** Print `"Retrospective saved to .codegraph/titan/retrospective.json — apply recommendations later by editing .claude/skills/titan-run/SKILL.md."` and finish.

---

## Error Handling

- **Sub-agent returns error:** Print the error, stop, and tell the user which phase failed and how to retry (e.g., "Run `/titan-run --start-from gauntlet`").
- **State file missing when expected:** Stop with clear message about which prerequisite phase to run.
- **State file corrupt (JSON parse error):** Attempt restore from `.bak`. If no backup → stop: "State file corrupted. Run `/titan-reset` and start over."
- **NDJSON corrupt lines:** Warn but continue — partial results are better than none. The corrupt lines are logged so the user knows which targets to re-audit.
- **Merge conflict detected by pre-agent gate:** Stop immediately with the conflicting files listed.
- **Tests fail after forge/grind phase:** Auto-spawn a regression-fix agent. If the fix agent resolves the failures, continue the pipeline. If it cannot, stop and print the failing commits so the user can revert.
- **Parity audit fails on drift introduced by this run:** Stop before CLOSE. Retry with `/titan-run --start-from parity` after fixing or reverting.
- **Validation failure (any V-check marked FAILED):** Stop with details. Warn-level V-checks are logged but don't stop the pipeline.

---

## Rules

- **You are the orchestrator, not the executor.** Never run codegraph commands, edit source files, or make commits yourself. Only spawn sub-agents and read state files. Exceptions (pure validation/snapshot, no code changes): the post-forge test run (V13), NDJSON integrity checks, the V3 baseline snapshot check (`codegraph snapshot list`), and the pre-forge architectural snapshot capture (Step 3.5a) are run directly by the orchestrator.
- **Run the Pre-Agent Gate (G1-G4) before EVERY sub-agent.** No exceptions.
- **One sub-agent at a time.** Phases are sequential — recon before gauntlet, gauntlet before sync, sync before forge, forge before grind, grind before parity (when the repo provides one), parity before close.
- **Fresh context per sub-agent.** This is the whole point — each sub-agent gets a clean context window.
- **Read AND validate state files after every sub-agent.** Trust the on-disk state, not the sub-agent's text output — but verify the state is structurally sound.
- **Back up state before every sub-agent.** The `.bak` file is your safety net against mid-write crashes.
- **Mandatory pause before forge** unless `--yes` is set. Analysis is safe; code changes deserve human review.
- **Stall detection is strict for forge** (2 retries) and looser for gauntlet (3 retries) since gauntlet is more likely to hit context limits legitimately.
- **Respect --start-from.** Skip phases before the specified starting point, but verify their artifacts exist AND pass validation.
- **Pass --yes through to forge** if the user provided it, so forge skips its per-phase confirmation prompt. Within the orchestrator, `--yes` also skips the pre-pipeline, forge checkpoint, and resume prompts.

## Self-Improvement

This skill lives at `.claude/skills/titan-run/SKILL.md`. It improves itself automatically via Step 6 (RETROSPECTIVE) at the end of every run.

For manual edits: use the Edit tool for targeted changes. Never rewrite sections unrelated to the fix. Commit skill changes separately from pipeline artifacts (`generated/titan/`, `.codegraph/titan/`) — they must not share a commit.

When adding new phases: update `meta.phases` at the top, add the phase to the timestamp list in Step 0.3, add a V-check for the phase's key artifact, and add the phase to Step 0.5's pre-validation table.
