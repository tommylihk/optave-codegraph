# Titan FORGE — Execute Sync Plan

You are running the **FORGE** phase of the Titan Paradigm.

Your goal: read `sync.json`, find the next incomplete execution phase, make the actual code changes for each target, validate with `/titan-gate`, commit, and advance state.

> **Context budget:** One phase per invocation. Do not attempt all phases in one session — the context window will fill. Run one phase, report, stop. User re-runs for the next phase.

**Arguments** (from `$ARGUMENTS`):
- No args → run next incomplete phase
- `--phase N` → jump to specific phase
- `--target <name>` → run single target only (for retrying failures)
- `--dry-run` → show what would be done without changing code
- `--yes` → skip confirmation prompt (typically passed by `/titan-run` orchestrator)

---

## Step 0 — Pre-flight

1. **Worktree check:**
   ```bash
   git rev-parse --show-toplevel && git worktree list
   ```
   If not in a worktree, stop: "Run `/worktree` first."

2. **Sync with main (conditional):**
   ```bash
   git fetch origin main
   behind=$(git rev-list HEAD..origin/main --count)
   ```
   - If `behind == 0` → already up to date, skip the merge entirely and print "Already up to date with origin/main."
   - If `behind > 0` → merge:
     ```bash
     git merge origin/main --no-edit
     ```
     If there are merge conflicts, stop: "Merge conflict detected. Resolve conflicts and re-run `/titan-forge`."

     After a successful merge, run a **duplicate-commit check** to detect re-applied work:
     ```bash
     git log origin/main..HEAD --no-merges --format="%s" | sort | uniq -d
     ```
     If any subjects are duplicated, print a warning listing them: "WARNING: Duplicate commit subjects found after merge — prior work may have been re-applied. Step 5 will auto-recover completed targets from git log so they are skipped." Do not stop — proceed to Step 3.

3. **Load artifacts.** Read:
   - `.codegraph/titan/sync.json` — execution plan (if missing: "Run `/titan-sync` first.")
   - `.codegraph/titan/titan-state.json` — current state
   - `.codegraph/titan/gauntlet.ndjson` — per-target audit details
   - `.codegraph/titan/gauntlet-summary.json` — aggregated results

4. **Validate state.** If `titan-state.json` has `currentPhase` other than `"sync"` and no existing `execution` block, stop: "State not ready. Run `/titan-sync` first."

5. **Initialize execution state** (if first run). Before writing a blank `execution` block, **recover already-completed work from the branch's git log** to prevent re-doing commits that are already on the branch:

   ```bash
   git log origin/main..HEAD --no-merges --format="%s"
   ```

   Cross-reference each subject line against `sync.json → executionOrder[*].targets[*].commitMessage`. For every match, mark that target as already completed and its phase as completed if all targets in the phase matched.

   Then write `titan-state.json` with the recovered state (pre-populated `completedTargets`, `completedPhases`, and `commits` from `git log origin/main..HEAD --no-merges --format="%H %s"`):

   ```json
   {
     "execution": {
       "currentPhase": <lowest incomplete phase, or 1 if none recovered>,
       "completedPhases": [<phases where all targets matched>],
       "currentTarget": null,
       "completedTargets": [<targets whose commit subjects appeared in git log>],
       "failedTargets": [],
       "commits": [<SHAs of matched commits>],
       "currentSubphase": null,
       "completedSubphases": [],
       "diffWarnings": []
     }
   }
   ```

   If any targets were recovered, print: "Recovered N completed targets from branch git log — skipping re-application."

6. **Determine next phase.** Use `--phase N` if provided, otherwise find the lowest phase number not in `completedPhases`.

7. **Print plan:**
   > Phase N: \<label\> — N targets, estimated N commits

8. **Ask for confirmation** before starting (unless `$ARGUMENTS` contains `--yes`).

---

## Step 1 — Phase-specific execution strategies

Each phase type requires different code-change logic:

### Phase 1: Dead code cleanup
- Delete the symbol/export
- Verify no consumers: `codegraph fn-impact <target> -T --json`
- Remove any orphaned imports
- Run lint to clean up

### Phase 2: Shared abstractions
- Extract function/interface to new or existing file
- Update imports in all consumers
- Verify with: `codegraph exports <file> -T --json`

### Phase 3: Empty catches / error handling
- Replace `catch {}` with `catch (e) { logger.debug(...) }` or explicit fallback
- Use contextually appropriate error handling
- Subphases: each distinct catch pattern = one commit

### Phase 4: Extractor decomposition
- Split large `walkXNode` switch cases into handler functions
- Keep dispatcher thin — handler per node kind
- Subphases: each extractor = one commit

### Phase 5: General decomposition
- Read the gauntlet recommendation for the specific target
- Apply the recommended decomposition strategy
- Subphases: each function split = one commit

### Phase 6: Small FAIL fixes
- Read the gauntlet recommendation for the specific target
- Apply the recommended fix (complexity reduction, metric improvement)
- Group by domain where possible

---

## Step 2 — Per-target execution loop

For each target in the current phase:

1. **Skip if done.** Check if target is already in `execution.completedTargets`. If so, skip.

2. **Update state.** Set `execution.currentTarget` in `titan-state.json`.

3. **Read gauntlet entry.** Find this target in `gauntlet.ndjson` → get recommendation, violations, metrics.

4. **Understand before touching.** Run codegraph commands:
   ```bash
   codegraph context <target> -T --json
   ```
   If blast radius > 0:
   ```bash
   codegraph fn-impact <target> -T --json
   ```

5. **Check if already fixed.** If the file has changed since gauntlet ran, re-check metrics:
   ```bash
   codegraph complexity --file <file> --health -T --json
   ```
   If the target now passes all thresholds, skip with note: "Target already passes — skipping."

6. **Read source file(s).** Understand the code before editing.

7. **Apply the change** based on phase strategy (Step 1) + gauntlet recommendation.

8. **Stage changed files:**
   ```bash
   git add <specific changed files>
   ```

9. **Diff review (intent verification):**
   Before running gate or tests, verify the diff matches the intent. This catches cases where the code change is structurally valid but doesn't match what was planned.

   Collect the context:
   ```bash
   git diff --cached --stat
   git diff --cached
   ```

   Load the gauntlet entry for this target (from `gauntlet.ndjson`) and the sync plan entry (from `sync.json → executionOrder.find(e => e.phase === currentPhase)`).

   **Check all of the following:**

   **D1. Scope — only planned files touched:**
   Compare staged file paths against `sync.json → executionOrder.find(e => e.phase === currentPhase).targets` and their known file paths (from gauntlet entries). Flag any file NOT associated with the current target or phase.
   - File in a completely different domain → **DIFF FAIL**
   - File is a direct dependency of the target (consumer or import) → **OK** (expected ripple)
   - Test file for the target → **OK**

   **D2. Intent match — diff aligns with gauntlet recommendation:**
   First, check if this target is a dead-code target (present in `titan-state.json → roles.deadSymbols`). If so, the expected recommendation is "remove dead code" — skip gauntlet entry lookup (dead-code targets have no gauntlet.ndjson entry) and verify the diff shows only deletions (no new functions or logic added). If the diff contains non-trivial additions for a dead-code target → **DIFF FAIL**.

   Otherwise, read the gauntlet entry's `recommendation` field and `violations` list. Verify the diff addresses them:
   - If recommendation says "split" → diff should show new functions extracted, original simplified
   - If recommendation says "remove dead code" → diff should show deletions, not additions
   - If violation was "complexity > threshold" → diff should reduce complexity, not just move code around
   - If the diff does something **entirely different** from the recommendation → **DIFF FAIL**

   **D3. Commit message accuracy:**
   Compare the planned commit message from `sync.json` against what the diff actually does.
   - Message says "remove dead code" but diff adds new functions → **DIFF WARN**
   - Message says "extract X from Y" but diff only modifies Y without creating X → **DIFF FAIL**

   **D4. Deletion audit:**
   If the diff deletes code (lines removed > 10), identify deleted symbols by comparing the pre-change file against removed lines:
   ```bash
   # Get the pre-change version's symbols (temp file for shell portability)
   D4_PRE_EXT="${changed_file##*.}"
   D4_PRE_TMP=$(mktemp "/tmp/titan-d4-pre-XXXXXX.${D4_PRE_EXT}")
   git show HEAD:<changed-file> > "$D4_PRE_TMP"
   codegraph where --file "$D4_PRE_TMP" -T --json 2>/dev/null
   rm -f "$D4_PRE_TMP"
   ```
   Cross-reference with `git diff --cached -- <changed-file>` to find symbols whose definitions appear only in removed lines (lines starting with `-`). For each deleted symbol:
   ```bash
   codegraph fn-impact <deleted-symbol> -T --json 2>/dev/null
   ```
   If the deleted symbol has active callers not updated in this diff → **DIFF FAIL**: "Deleted <symbol> still has <N> callers not updated in this commit."

   **D5. Leftover check:**
   If the gauntlet recommendation mentioned specific symbols to remove/refactor, verify they were actually addressed:
   - Dead symbols listed for removal but still present in the diff → **DIFF WARN**: "Gauntlet listed `<symbol>` for removal but it was not deleted."
   - Functions marked for decomposition but original is unchanged → **DIFF WARN**: "Gauntlet recommended decomposing `<symbol>` but original function was not simplified."
   - If all recommended symbols were addressed → **DIFF PASS** (implicit — no warnings emitted)

   **On DIFF FAIL:**
   ```bash
   git reset HEAD -- $(git diff --cached --name-only)
   git checkout -- $(git diff --name-only)
   ```
   Add to `execution.failedTargets` with reason starting with `"diff-review: "`. Continue to next target.
   **On DIFF WARN:** Log the warning but proceed to gate. Include the warning in the gate-log entry.

10. **Run tests** — detect the project's test command from `package.json` (same detection as gate Step 4):
    ```bash
    testCmd=$(node -e "const p=require('./package.json');const s=p.scripts||{};const script=s.test?'test':s['test:ci']?'test:ci':null;if(!script){console.log('NO_TEST_SCRIPT');process.exit(0);}const fs=require('fs');const runner=fs.existsSync('yarn.lock')?'yarn':fs.existsSync('pnpm-lock.yaml')?'pnpm':fs.existsSync('bun.lockb')?'bun':'npm';console.log(runner+(script==='test'?' test':' run '+script));")
    ```
    - If `testCmd == "NO_TEST_SCRIPT"` → skip pre-gate test run (no test script configured).
    - Otherwise:
      ```bash
      $testCmd 2>&1
      ```
      If tests fail → go to rollback (step 13).

    > **Note:** Gate (Step 11) also runs tests. This pre-gate test is a fast-fail optimization — it catches obvious breakage before running the full gate checks (codegraph analysis, semantic assertions, arch snapshot). For projects with fast test suites the duplication is negligible; for slow suites, the tradeoff is: catch failures ~2x faster at the cost of ~2x test time on passing targets.

11. **Run /titan-gate:**
    Use the Skill tool to invoke `titan-gate`.
    - If FAIL on **cycle/test/lint/build** (gate auto-rolls back staged changes on Step 2/4 cycle; Step 1 may also report cycle violation via `--cycles` flag — treat that the same as Step 2) → go to rollback (step 13) to also revert working tree.
    - If FAIL on **any other check** — complexity (Step 3), semantic (Step 5), structural/arch (Steps 1, 5.5, 6-8) — gate does NOT auto-rollback its staging area; forge must clean up for the next target → unstage with `git reset HEAD -- $(git diff --cached --name-only) && git checkout -- $(git diff --name-only)`, add to `execution.failedTargets` with reason, log the gate report, and continue to the next target. Do NOT go to step 13 — that step is for Step 2/4 failures where gate already unstaged; going there again would attempt a duplicate rollback.

12. **On success:**
    ```bash
    git commit -m "<commit message from sync.json>"
    ```
    - Record commit SHA in `execution.commits`
    - Add target to `execution.completedTargets`
    - Record any diff-review warnings by **appending** to `execution.diffWarnings` (if any). Each entry must follow this schema:
      ```json
      { "target": "<target-name>", "check": "<D3 or D5>", "message": "<warning text>", "phase": N }
      ```
    - Update `titan-state.json`

13. **On failure (test or gate):**
    ```bash
    # Discover dirty files at rollback time (don't rely on carried file list)
    git reset HEAD -- $(git diff --cached --name-only)
    git checkout -- $(git diff --name-only)
    ```
    - Add to `execution.failedTargets` with reason: `{ "target": "<name>", "reason": "<why>", "phase": N }`
    - Clear `execution.currentTarget`
    - **Continue to next target** — don't block the whole phase

---

## Step 3 — Phase completion

When all targets in the phase are processed:

1. Add phase number to `execution.completedPhases`
2. Advance `execution.currentPhase` to the next phase number
3. Clear `execution.currentTarget`
4. Write updated `titan-state.json`

---

## Step 4 — Report

Print:

```
## Phase N Complete: <label>

Targets: X/Y completed, Z failed
Commits: N
Files changed: N

### Failed targets (if any):
- <target>: <reason>

### Next: Phase M — <label> (N targets)
Run /titan-forge to continue.
```

If all phases are complete:

```
## All phases complete

Total commits: N
Total targets: X completed, Y failed
Failed targets: <list or "none">

Run /titan-gate on the full branch to validate.
```

---

## Edge Cases

- **Test failure mid-phase:** Revert target, mark failed, continue. Don't block the whole phase.
- **Merge conflict with main:** Stop, report, ask user to resolve.
- **Gate detects new cycle:** Stop immediately — this is a real problem, not skippable.
- **Target already fixed on main:** Check if file has changed since gauntlet. If metrics now pass, skip with note.
- **Interrupted mid-phase:** Re-running picks up from `execution.currentTarget`. Already-committed targets are skipped.
- **`--dry-run`:** Walk through all targets, print what would be done (phase strategy, gauntlet recommendation, files affected), but make no changes.
- **`--target <name>`:** Run only that target. Useful for retrying entries in `failedTargets`.

---

## Rules

- **One phase per invocation.** Stop after the phase completes. User re-runs for next.
- **Resumable.** If interrupted, re-running picks up where it left off.
- **Always use `--json` and `-T`** for codegraph commands.
- **Gate before commit.** Every commit must pass `/titan-gate`. No exceptions.
- **One commit per logical unit.** Use commit messages from `sync.json`.
- **Stage only specific files.** Never `git add .` or `git add -A`.
- **Rollback on failure is gentle** — `git reset HEAD -- $(git diff --cached --name-only)` to unstage, then `git checkout -- $(git diff --name-only)` to revert working tree. Never `git reset --hard`.
- **Subphase awareness** — phases 3-6 have subphases. Each subphase = one commit. Track at subphase level.
- **Never skip `/titan-gate`.** Even for "trivial" changes.
