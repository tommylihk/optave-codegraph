> **Zero network calls. Zero telemetry. Your code never leaves your machine.**
>
> Codegraph uses [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/) (via WASM — no native compilation required) to parse your codebase into an AST, extracts functions, classes, imports, and call sites, resolves dependencies, and stores everything in a local SQLite database. Query it instantly from the command line.

## 💡 Why codegraph?

<sub>Comparison last verified: February 2026</sub>

Most dependency graph tools only tell you which **files** import which — codegraph tells you which **functions** call which, who their callers are, and what breaks when something changes. Here's how it compares to the alternatives:

### Feature comparison

| Capability | codegraph | Madge | dep-cruiser | Skott | Nx graph | Sourcetrail |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Function-level analysis | **Yes** | — | — | — | — | **Yes** |
| Multi-language | **10** | 1 | 1 | 1 | Any (project) | 4 |
| Semantic search | **Yes** | — | — | — | — | — |
| MCP / AI agent support | **Yes** | — | — | — | — | — |
| Git diff impact | **Yes** | — | — | — | Partial | — |
| Persistent database | **Yes** | — | — | — | — | Yes |
| Watch mode | **Yes** | — | — | — | Daemon | — |
| CI workflow included | **Yes** | — | Rules | — | Yes | — |
| Cycle detection | **Yes** | Yes | Yes | Yes | — | — |
| Zero config | **Yes** | Yes | — | Yes | — | — |
| Fully local / no telemetry | **Yes** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Partial | Yes |
| Free & open source | **Yes** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Partial | Archived |

### What makes codegraph different

| | Differentiator | In practice |
|---|---|---|
| **🔬** | **Function-level, not just files** | Traces `handleAuth()` → `validateToken()` → `decryptJWT()` and shows 14 callers across 9 files break if `decryptJWT` changes |
| **🌐** | **Multi-language, one CLI** | JS/TS + Python + Go + Rust + Java + C# + PHP + Ruby + Terraform in a single graph — no juggling Madge, pyan, and cflow |
| **🤖** | **AI-agent ready** | Built-in [MCP server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) — AI assistants query your graph directly via `codegraph fn <name>` |
| **💥** | **Git diff impact** | `codegraph diff-impact` shows changed functions, their callers, and full blast radius — ships with a GitHub Actions workflow |
| **🔒** | **Fully local, zero telemetry** | No accounts, no API keys, no cloud, no data exfiltration — Apache-2.0, free forever |
| **⚡** | **Build once, query instantly** | SQLite-backed — build in ~30s, every query under 100ms. Native Rust engine with WASM fallback. Most competitors re-parse every run |
| **🧠** | **Semantic search** | `codegraph search "handle auth"` uses local embeddings — multi-query with RRF ranking via `"auth; token; JWT"` |

### How other tools compare

Many tools in this space are cloud-based or SaaS — meaning your code leaves your machine. Others require external services, accounts, or API keys. Codegraph makes **zero network calls** and has **zero telemetry**. Everything runs locally.

| Tool | What it does well | Where it falls short |
|---|---|---|
| [Madge](https://github.com/pahen/madge) | Simple file-level JS/TS dependency graphs | No function-level analysis, no impact tracing, JS/TS only |
| [dependency-cruiser](https://github.com/sverweij/dependency-cruiser) | Architectural rule validation for JS/TS | Module-level only (function-level explicitly out of scope), requires config |
| [Skott](https://github.com/antoine-music/skott) | Module graph with unused code detection | File-level only, JS/TS only, no persistent database |
| [Nx graph](https://nx.dev/) | Monorepo project-level dependency graph | Requires Nx workspace, project-level only (not file or function) |
| [Sourcetrail](https://github.com/CoatiSoftware/Sourcetrail) | Rich GUI with symbol-level graphs | Archived/discontinued (2021), no JS/TS, no CLI |
| [Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com/) | Enterprise code search and navigation | Cloud/SaaS — code sent to servers, $19+/user/mo, no longer open source |
| [CodeSee](https://www.codesee.io/) | Visual codebase maps | Cloud-based — code leaves your machine, acquired by GitKraken |
| [Understand](https://scitools.com/) | Deep multi-language static analysis | $100+/month per seat, proprietary, GUI-only, no CI or AI integration |
| [Snyk Code](https://snyk.io/) | AI-powered security scanning | Cloud-based — code sent to Snyk servers for analysis, not a dependency graph tool |
| [pyan](https://github.com/Technologicat/pyan) / [cflow](https://www.gnu.org/software/cflow/) | Function-level call graphs | Single-language each (Python / C only), no persistence, no queries |

codegraph export --functions -o graph.dot  # Function-level, write to file
codegraph cycles               # Detect circular dependencies
codegraph cycles --functions   # Function-level cycles
```

### Semantic Search

Codegraph can build local embeddings for every function, method, and class, then search them by natural language. Everything runs locally using [@huggingface/transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js) — no API keys needed.

```bash
codegraph embed                # Build embeddings (default: minilm)
codegraph embed --model nomic  # Use a different model
codegraph search "handle authentication"
codegraph search "parse config" --min-score 0.4 -n 10
codegraph models               # List available models
```

#### Multi-query search

Separate queries with `;` to search from multiple angles at once. Results are ranked using [Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)](https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~gvcormac/cormacksigir09-rrf.pdf) — items that rank highly across multiple queries rise to the top.

```bash
codegraph search "auth middleware; JWT validation"
codegraph search "parse config; read settings; load env" -n 20
codegraph search "error handling; retry logic" --kind function
codegraph search "database connection; query builder" --rrf-k 30
```

A single trailing semicolon is ignored (falls back to single-query mode). The `--rrf-k` flag controls the RRF smoothing constant (default 60) — lower values give more weight to top-ranked results.

#### Available Models

| Flag | Model | Dimensions | Size | License | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `minilm` (default) | all-MiniLM-L6-v2 | 384 | ~23 MB | Apache-2.0 | Fastest, good for quick iteration |
| `jina-small` | jina-embeddings-v2-small-en | 512 | ~33 MB | Apache-2.0 | Better quality, still small |
| `jina-base` | jina-embeddings-v2-base-en | 768 | ~137 MB | Apache-2.0 | High quality, 8192 token context |
| `jina-code` | jina-embeddings-v2-base-code | 768 | ~137 MB | Apache-2.0 | **Best for code search**, trained on code+text |
| `nomic` | nomic-embed-text-v1 | 768 | ~137 MB | Apache-2.0 | Good quality, 8192 context |
| `nomic-v1.5` | nomic-embed-text-v1.5 | 768 | ~137 MB | Apache-2.0 | Improved nomic, Matryoshka dimensions |
| `bge-large` | bge-large-en-v1.5 | 1024 | ~335 MB | MIT | Best general retrieval, top MTEB scores |

The model used during `embed` is stored in the database, so `search` auto-detects it — no need to pass `--model` when searching.

### AI Integration

| `-d, --db <path>` | Custom path to `graph.db` |
| `-T, --no-tests` | Exclude `.test.`, `.spec.`, `__test__` files |
| `--depth <n>` | Transitive trace depth (default varies by command) |
| `-j, --json` | Output as JSON |
| `-v, --verbose` | Enable debug output |
| `--engine <engine>` | Parser engine: `native`, `wasm`, or `auto` (default: `auto`) |
| `-k, --kind <kind>` | Filter by kind: `function`, `method`, `class` (search) |

```

1. **Parse** — tree-sitter parses every source file into an AST (native Rust engine or WASM fallback)
2. **Extract** — Functions, classes, methods, interfaces, imports, exports, and call sites are extracted
3. **Resolve** — Imports are resolved to actual files (handles ESM conventions, `tsconfig.json` path aliases, `baseUrl`)
4. **Store** — Everything goes into SQLite as nodes + edges with tree-sitter node boundaries
5. **Query** — All queries run locally against the SQLite DB — typically under 100ms

### Dual Engine

Codegraph ships with two parsing engines:

| Engine | How it works | When it's used |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Native** (Rust) | napi-rs addon built from `crates/codegraph-core/` — parallel multi-core parsing via rayon | Auto-selected when the prebuilt binary is available |
| **WASM** | `web-tree-sitter` with pre-built `.wasm` grammars in `grammars/` | Fallback when the native addon isn't installed |

Both engines produce identical output. Use `--engine native|wasm|auto` to control selection (default: `auto`).

### Call Resolution

Calls are resolved with priority and confidence scoring:

| Priority | Source | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Import-aware** — `import { foo } from './bar'` → link to `bar` | `1.0` |
| 2 | **Same-file** — definitions in the current file | `1.0` |
| 3 | **Same directory** — definitions in sibling files | `0.7` |
| 4 | **Same parent directory** — definitions in sibling dirs | `0.5` |
| 5 | **Global fallback** — match by name across codebase | `0.3` |
| 6 | **Method hierarchy** — resolved through `extends`/`implements` | — |

Dynamic patterns like `fn.call()`, `fn.apply()`, `fn.bind()`, and `obj["method"]()` are also detected on a best-effort basis.

## 📊 Performance

Benchmarked on a ~3,200-file TypeScript project:

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Build time | ~30s |
| Nodes | 19,000+ |
| Edges | 120,000+ |
| Query time | <100ms |
| DB size | ~5 MB |

## 🤖 AI Agent Integration

### MCP Server

Codegraph includes a built-in [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server, so AI assistants can query your dependency graph directly:

```bash
codegraph mcp
```

### CLAUDE.md / Agent Instructions

Add this to your project's `CLAUDE.md` to help AI agents use codegraph:

```markdown
## Code Navigation

This project uses codegraph. The database is at `.codegraph/graph.db`.

- **Before modifying a function**: `codegraph fn <name> --no-tests`
- **Before modifying a file**: `codegraph deps <file>`
- **To assess PR impact**: `codegraph diff-impact --no-tests`
- **To find entry points**: `codegraph map`
- **To trace breakage**: `codegraph fn-impact <name> --no-tests`

Rebuild after major structural changes: `codegraph build`

### Semantic search

Use `codegraph search` to find functions by intent rather than exact name.
When a single query might miss results, combine multiple angles with `;`:

  codegraph search "validate auth; check token; verify JWT"
  codegraph search "parse config; load settings" --kind function

Multi-query search uses Reciprocal Rank Fusion — functions that rank
highly across several queries surface first. This is especially useful
when you're not sure what naming convention the codebase uses.

When writing multi-queries, use 2-4 sub-queries (2-4 words each) that
attack the problem from different angles. Pick from these strategies:
- **Naming variants**: cover synonyms the author might have used
  ("send email; notify user; deliver message")
- **Abstraction levels**: pair high-level intent with low-level operation
  ("handle payment; charge credit card")
- **Input/output sides**: cover the read half and write half
  ("parse config; apply settings")
- **Domain + technical**: bridge business language and implementation
  ("onboard tenant; create organization; provision workspace")

Use `--kind function` to cut noise. Use `--file <pattern>` to scope.
```

## 📋 Recommended Practices

See **[docs/recommended-practices.md](docs/recommended-practices.md)** for integration guides:

- **Git hooks** — auto-rebuild on commit, impact checks on push, commit message enrichment
- **CI/CD** — PR impact comments, threshold gates, graph caching
- **AI agents** — MCP server, CLAUDE.md templates, Claude Code hooks
- **Developer workflow** — watch mode, explore-before-you-edit, semantic search
- **Secure credentials** — `apiKeyCommand` with 1Password, Bitwarden, Vault, macOS Keychain, `pass`

## 🔁 CI / GitHub Actions

Codegraph ships with a ready-to-use GitHub Actions workflow that comments impact analysis on every pull request.

Copy `.github/workflows/codegraph-impact.yml` to your repo, and every PR will get a comment like:

> **3 functions changed** → **12 callers affected** across **7 files**

## 🛠️ Configuration

Create a `.codegraphrc.json` in your project root to customize behavior:

```json
{
  "include": ["src/**", "lib/**"],
  "exclude": ["**/*.test.js", "**/__mocks__/**"],
  "ignoreDirs": ["node_modules", ".git", "dist"],
  "extensions": [".js", ".ts", ".tsx", ".py"],
  "aliases": {
    "@/": "./src/",
    "@utils/": "./src/utils/"
  },
  "build": {
    "incremental": true
  }
}
```

### LLM credentials

Codegraph supports an `apiKeyCommand` field for secure credential management. Instead of storing API keys in config files or environment variables, you can shell out to a secret manager at runtime:

```json
{
  "llm": {
    "provider": "openai",
    "apiKeyCommand": "op read op://vault/openai/api-key"
  }
}
```

The command is split on whitespace and executed with `execFileSync` (no shell injection risk). Priority: **command output > `CODEGRAPH_LLM_API_KEY` env var > file config**. On failure, codegraph warns and falls back to the next source.

Works with any secret manager: 1Password CLI (`op`), Bitwarden (`bw`), `pass`, HashiCorp Vault, macOS Keychain (`security`), AWS Secrets Manager, etc.

## 📖 Programmatic API

Codegraph also exports a full API for use in your own tools:

```js
import { buildGraph, queryNameData, findCycles, exportDOT } from '@optave/codegraph';

// Build the graph
buildGraph('/path/to/project');

// Query programmatically
const results = queryNameData('myFunction', '/path/to/.codegraph/graph.db');
```

```js
import { parseFileAuto, getActiveEngine, isNativeAvailable } from '@optave/codegraph';

// Check which engine is active
console.log(getActiveEngine());      // 'native' or 'wasm'
console.log(isNativeAvailable());    // true if Rust addon is installed

// Parse a single file (uses auto-selected engine)
const symbols = await parseFileAuto('/path/to/file.ts');
```

```js
import { searchData, multiSearchData, buildEmbeddings } from '@optave/codegraph';

// Build embeddings (one-time)
await buildEmbeddings('/path/to/project');

// Single-query search
const { results } = await searchData('handle auth', dbPath);

// Multi-query search with RRF ranking
const { results: fused } = await multiSearchData(
  ['auth middleware', 'JWT validation'],
  dbPath,
  { limit: 10, minScore: 0.3 }
);
// Each result has: { name, kind, file, line, rrf, queryScores[] }
```

## ⚠️ Limitations

- **No full type inference** — parses `.d.ts` interfaces but doesn't use TypeScript's type checker for overload resolution
- **Dynamic calls are best-effort** — complex computed property access and `eval` patterns are not resolved
- **Python imports** — resolves relative imports but doesn't follow `sys.path` or virtual environment packages

## 🗺️ Roadmap

See **[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)** for the full development roadmap. Current plan:

1. ~~**Rust Core**~~ — **Complete** (v1.3.0) — native tree-sitter parsing via napi-rs, parallel multi-core parsing, incremental re-parsing, import resolution & cycle detection in Rust
2. **Foundation Hardening** — ~~parser registry~~, complete MCP server, test coverage, enhanced config
3. **Intelligent Embeddings** — LLM-generated descriptions, hybrid search
4. **Natural Language Queries** — `codegraph ask` command, conversational sessions
5. **Expanded Language Support** — 8 new languages (12 → 20)
6. **GitHub Integration & CI** — reusable GitHub Action, PR review, SARIF output
7. **Visualization & Advanced** — web UI, dead code detection, monorepo support, agentic search
